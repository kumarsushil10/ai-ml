A member of the Republican Party, he served as the 45th president from 2017 to 2021.\\n\\nBorn in New York City, Trump graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968 with a bachelor\\'s degree in economics. He became the president of his family\\'s real estate business in 1971, renamed it the Trump Organization, and began acquiring and building skyscrapers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. After six business bankruptcies in the 1990s and 2000s, he began side ventures. From 2004 to 2015, he hosted the reality television show The Apprentice. A political outsider, Trump won the 2016 presidential election against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.\\n\\nIn his first term, Trump imposed a travel ban on citizens from six Muslim-majority countries, expanded the U.S.–Mexico border wall, and implemented a family separation policy. He rolled back environmental and business regulations, signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and appointed three Supreme Court justices. In foreign policy, Trump withdrew the U.S. from agreements on climate, trade, and Iran\\'s nuclear program, began a trade war with China, and met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un without reaching a deal on denuclearization. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, he downplayed its severity, contradicted health officials, and signed the CARES Act stimulus. Trump was impeached in 2019 for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, and in 2021 for incitement of insurrection; the Senate acquitted him in both cases. After his first term, scholars and historians ranked him as one of the worst presidents in American history.\\n\\nTrump is the central figure of Trumpism. Many of his comments and actions have been characterized as racially charged, racist, or misogynistic. He has made false and misleading statements and promoted conspiracy theories to a degree unprecedented in American politics. After losing the 2020 presidential election to Joe Biden, Trump attempted to overturn the outcome, culminating in the January 6 Capitol attack in 2021. In 2023, Trump was found liable in civil cases for sexual abuse and defamation and for business fraud, and in 2024, he was found guilty of falsifying business records, making him the first U.S. president convicted of a felony. After winning the 2024 presidential election against Kamala Harris, Trump was sentenced to a penalty-free discharge, and two other felony indictments against him were dismissed.\\n\\nTrump began his second term by pardoning around 1,500 January 6 rioters, initiating mass layoffs of the federal workforce, and starting a trade war with Mexico and Canada. Trump\\'s broad and extensive use of executive orders has drawn numerous lawsuits challenging their legality.\\n\\nEarly life and education\\nA black-and-white photograph of Trump as a teenager, smiling, wearing a dark pseudo-military uniform with various badges and a light-colored stripe crossing his right shoulder\\nTrump at New York Military Academy, 1964\\nDonald John Trump was born on June 14, 1946, at Jamaica Hospital in the New York City borough of Queens, the fourth child of Fred Trump and Mary Anne MacLeod Trump.[1] He is of German and Scottish descent.[2] He grew up with his older siblings, Maryanne, Fred Jr., and Elizabeth, and his younger brother, Robert, in a mansion in the Jamaica Estates neighborhood of Queens.[3] Fred Trump paid his children each about $20,000 a year, equivalent to $265,000 a year in 2024. Trump was a millionaire at age eight by contemporary standards.[a][4]\\n\\nTrump attended the private Kew-Forest School through seventh grade. He was a difficult child and showed an early interest in his father\\'s business. His father enrolled him in New York Military Academy, a private boarding school, to complete secondary school.[5] Trump considered a show business career but instead in 1964 enrolled at Fordham University.[6] Two years later, he transferred to the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, graduating in May 1968 with a Bachelor of Science in economics.[7][8]\\n\\nHe was exempted from the draft during the Vietnam War due to a claim of bone spurs in his heels.[9]\\n\\nBusiness career\\nMain article: Business career of Donald Trump\\nFurther information: Business projects of Donald Trump in Russia and Tax returns of Donald Trump\\nReal estate\\nStarting in 1968, Trump was employed at his father\\'s real estate company, Trump Management, which owned racially segregated middle-class rental housing in New York City\\'s outer boroughs.[10][11] In 1971, his father made him president of the company and he began using the Trump Organization as an umbrella brand.[12] Roy Cohn was Trump\\'s fixer, lawyer, and mentor[13] for 13 years in the 1970s and 1980s.[14] In 1973, Cohn helped Trump countersue the U.S. government for $100 million (equivalent to $708 million in 2024)[15] over its charges that Trump\\'s properties had racially discriminatory practices. Trump\\'s counterclaims were dismissed, and the government\\'s case was settled with the Trumps signing a consent decree agreeing to desegregate; four years later, Trumps again faced the courts when they were found in contempt of the decree.[16] Before age thirty, he showed his propensity for litigation, no matter the outcome and cost; even when he lost, he described the case as a win.[17] Helping Trump projects,[18] Cohn was a consigliere whose Mafia connections controlled construction unions.[19] Cohn introduced political consultant Roger Stone to Trump, who enlisted Stone\\'s services to deal with the federal government.[20] Between 1991 and 2009, he filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for six of his businesses: the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan, the casinos in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and the Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts company.[21][22]\\n\\nIn 1992, Trump, his siblings Maryanne, Elizabeth, and Robert, and his cousin John W. Walter, each with a 20 percent share, formed All County Building Supply & Maintenance Corp. The company had no offices and is alleged to have been a shell company for paying the vendors providing services and supplies for Trump\\'s rental units, then billing those services and supplies to Trump Management with markups of 20–50 percent and more. The owners shared the proceeds generated by the markups. The increased costs were used to get state approval for increasing the rents of his rent-stabilized units.[23]\\n\\nManhattan and Chicago developments\\n\\nTrump in 1985 with a model of one of his aborted Manhattan development projects[24]\\nTrump attracted public attention in 1978 with the launch of his family\\'s first Manhattan venture: the renovation of the derelict Commodore Hotel, adjacent to Grand Central Terminal.[25] The financing was facilitated by a $400 million city property tax abatement arranged for him by his father who also, jointly with Hyatt, guaranteed a $70 million bank construction loan.[11][26] The hotel reopened in 1980 as the Grand Hyatt Hotel,[27] and that same year, he obtained rights to develop Trump Tower, a mixed-use skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan.[28] The building houses the headquarters of the Trump Corporation and Trump\\'s PAC and was his primary residence until 2019.[29] In 1988, Trump acquired the Plaza Hotel with a loan from a consortium of 16 banks.[30] The hotel filed for bankruptcy protection in 1992, and a reorganization plan was approved a month later, with the banks taking control of the property.[31]\\n\\nIn 1995, he defaulted on over $3 billion of bank loans, and the lenders seized the Plaza Hotel along with most of his other properties in a \"vast and humiliating restructuring\" that allowed him to avoid personal bankruptcy.[32][33] The lead bank\\'s attorney said of the banks\\' decision that they \"all agreed that he\\'d be better alive than dead\".[32] In 1996, Trump acquired and renovated the mostly vacant 71-story skyscraper at 40 Wall Street, later rebranded as the Trump Building.[34] In the early 1990s, he won the right to develop a 70-acre (28 ha) tract in the Lincoln Square neighborhood near the Hudson River. Struggling with debt from other ventures in 1994, he sold most of his interest in the project to Asian investors, who financed the project\\'s completion, Riverside South.[35] Trump\\'s last major construction project was the 92-story mixed-use Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago which opened in 2008. In 2024, The New York Times and ProPublica reported that the Internal Revenue Service was investigating whether he had twice written off losses incurred through construction cost overruns and lagging sales of residential units in the building he had declared to be worthless on his 2008 tax return.[36]\\n\\nAtlantic City casinos\\nThe entrance of the Trump Taj Mahal, a casino in Atlantic City. It has motifs evocative of the Taj Mahal in India.\\nEntrance of the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City\\nIn 1984, Trump opened Harrah\\'s at Trump Plaza, a hotel and casino, with financing and management help from the Holiday Corporation.[37] It was unprofitable, and he paid Holiday $70 million in May 1986 to take sole control.[38] In 1985, he bought the unopened Atlantic City Hilton Hotel and renamed it Trump Castle.[39] Both casinos filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1992.[40] Trump bought a third Atlantic City venue in 1988, the Trump Taj Mahal. It was financed with $675 million in junk bonds and completed for $1.1 billion, opening in April 1990.[37] He filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1991. Under the provisions of the restructuring agreement, he gave up half his initial stake and personally guaranteed future performance.[41] To reduce his $900 million of personal debt, he sold the Trump Shuttle airline; his megayacht, the Trump Princess, which had been leased to his casinos and kept docked; and other businesses.[42] In 1995, Trump founded Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts (THCR), which assumed ownership of the Trump Plaza.[43] THCR purchased the Taj Mahal and the Trump Castle in 1996 and went bankrupt in 2004 and 2009, leaving him with 10 percent ownership.[37] He remained chairman until 2009.[44]\\n\\nClubs\\nIn 1985, Trump acquired the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida.[45] In 1995, he converted the estate into a private club with an initiation fee and annual dues. He continued to use a wing of the house as a private residence.[46] He declared the club his primary residence in 2019.[29] He began building and buying golf courses in 1999, owning 17 golf courses by 2016.[47]\\n\\nLicensing the Trump name\\nSee also: List of things named after Donald Trump\\nThe Trump Organization often licensed the Trump name for consumer products and services, including foodstuffs, apparel, learning courses, and home furnishings.[48] Over 50 licensing or management deals involved Trump\\'s name, generating at least $59 million for his companies.[49] By 2018, only two consumer goods companies continued to license his name.[48] During the 2000s, Trump licensed his name to residential property developments worldwide, 40 of which were never built.[50]\\n\\nSide ventures\\nTrump, Doug Flutie, and an unnamed official standing behind a lectern with big, round New Jersey Generals sign, with members of the press seated in the background\\nTrump and New Jersey Generals quarterback Doug Flutie at a 1985 press conference in Trump Tower\\nIn 1970, Trump invested $70,000 to receive billing as coproducer of a Broadway comedy.[51] In September 1983, he purchased the New Jersey Generals, a team in the United States Football League. After the 1985 season, the league folded, largely due to his attempt to move to a fall schedule (when it would have competed with the National Football League [NFL] for audience) and trying to force a merger with the NFL by bringing an antitrust suit.[52] Trump and his Plaza Hotel hosted several boxing matches at the Atlantic City Convention Hall.[37][53] In 1989 and 1990, he lent his name to the Tour de Trump cycling stage race, an attempt to create an American equivalent of European races such as the Tour de France or the Giro d\\'Italia.[54] From 1986 to 1988, he purchased significant blocks of shares in various public companies while suggesting that he intended to take over the company and then sold his shares for a profit,[55] leading some observers to think he was engaged in greenmail.[56] The New York Times found that he initially made millions of dollars in such stock transactions, but \"lost most, if not all, of those gains after investors stopped taking his takeover talk seriously\".[55]\\n\\nA red star with a bronze outline and \"Donald Trump\" and a TV icon written on it in bronze, embedded in a black terrazzo sidewalk\\nTrump\\'s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame\\nIn 1988, Trump purchased the Eastern Air Lines Shuttle, financing the purchase with $380 million (equivalent to $1010 million in 2024)[15] in loans from a syndicate of 22 banks. He renamed the airline Trump Shuttle and operated it until 1992.[57] He defaulted on his loans in 1991, and ownership passed to the banks.[58] In 1996, he purchased the Miss Universe pageants, including Miss USA and Miss Teen USA.[59] Due to disagreements with CBS about scheduling, he took both pageants to NBC in 2002.[60][61] In 2007, he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his work as producer of Miss Universe.[62] NBC and Univision dropped the pageants in June 2015 in reaction to his comments about Mexican immigrants.[63]\\n\\nIn 2005, Trump cofounded Trump University, a company that sold real estate seminars for up to $35,000. After New York State authorities notified the company that its use of \"university\" violated state law (as it was not an academic institution), its name was changed to the Trump Entrepreneur Initiative in 2010.[64] In 2013, the State of New York filed a $40 million civil suit against Trump University, alleging that the company made false statements and defrauded consumers. Additionally, two class actions were filed in federal court against Trump and his companies. Internal documents revealed that employees were instructed to use a hard-sell approach, and former employees testified that Trump University had defrauded or lied to its students.[65] Shortly after he won the 2016 presidential election, he agreed to pay a total of $25 million to settle the three cases.[66]\\n\\nFoundation\\nMain article: Donald J. Trump Foundation\\nThe Donald J. Trump Foundation was a private foundation established in 1988.[67] From 1987 to 2006, Trump gave his foundation $5.4 million which had been spent by the end of 2006. After donating a total of $65,000 in 2007–2008, he stopped donating any personal funds to the charity,[68] which received millions from other donors, including $5 million from Vince McMahon.[69] The foundation gave to health- and sports-related charities, conservative groups,[70] and charities that held events at Trump properties.[68] In 2016, The Washington Post reported that the charity had committed several potential legal and ethical violations, including self-dealing and tax evasion.[71] Also in 2016, the New York attorney general said the foundation had violated state law by soliciting donations without submitting to required annual external audits and ordered it to cease its fundraising activities in New York immediately.[72] Trump\\'s team announced in December 2016 that the foundation would be dissolved.[73] In June 2018, the New York attorney general\\'s office filed a civil suit against the foundation, Trump, and his adult children, seeking $2.8 million in restitution and additional penalties.[74] In December 2018, the foundation ceased operation and disbursed its assets to other charities.[75] In November 2019, a New York state judge ordered Trump to pay $2 million to a group of charities for misusing the foundation\\'s funds, in part to finance his presidential campaign.[76]\\n\\nLegal affairs and bankruptcies\\nMain article: Personal and business legal affairs of Donald Trump\\nAccording to a review of state and federal court files conducted by USA Today in 2018, Trump and his businesses had been involved in more than 4,000 state and federal legal actions.[77] While he has not filed for personal bankruptcy, his over-leveraged hotel and casino businesses in Atlantic City and New York filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection six times between 1991 and 2009.[78] They continued to operate while the banks restructured debt and reduced his shares in the properties.[78] During the 1980s, more than 70 banks had lent Trump $4 billion.[79] After his corporate bankruptcies of the early 1990s, most major banks, with the exception of Deutsche Bank, declined to lend to him.[80] After the January 6 Capitol attack, the bank decided not to do business with him or his company in the future.[81]\\n\\nWealth\\nMain article: Wealth of Donald Trump\\nIvana Trump and King Fahd shake hands, with Ronald Reagan standing next to them smiling\\nTrump (rightmost) and wife Ivana at a 1985 state dinner for King Fahd of Saudi Arabia with President Ronald Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan\\nTrump has said he began his career with \"a small loan of a million dollars\" from his father and that he had to pay it back with interest.[82] He borrowed at least $60 million from his father, largely did not repay the loans, and received another $413 million (2018 equivalent, adjusted for inflation) from his father\\'s company.[83][23] Posing as a Trump Organization official named \"John Barron\", Trump called journalist Jonathan Greenberg in 1984, trying to get a higher ranking on the Forbes 400 list of wealthy Americans.[84] Trump self-reported his net worth over a wide range: from a low of minus $900 million in 1990,[b] to a high of $10 billion in 2015.[87] In 2024, Forbes estimated his net worth at $2.3 billion and ranked him the 1,438th wealthiest person in the world.[88]\\n\\nMedia career\\nMain article: Media career of Donald Trump\\nSee also: Bibliography of Donald Trump\\nTrump has published 19 books under his name, most written or cowritten by ghostwriters.[89] His first book, The Art of the Deal (1987), was a New York Times Best Seller, and was credited by The New Yorker with making Trump famous as an \"emblem of the successful tycoon\".[90] The book was ghostwritten by Tony Schwartz, who is credited as a coauthor. Trump had cameos in many films and television shows from 1985 to 2001.[91] Starting in the 1990s, Trump appeared 24 times as a guest on the nationally syndicated Howard Stern Show.[92] He had his own short-form talk radio program, Trumped!, from 2004 to 2008.[93] From 2011 until 2015, he was a guest commentator on Fox & Friends.[94] In 2021, Trump, who had been a member since 1989, resigned from SAG-AFTRA to avoid a disciplinary hearing regarding the January 6 attack.[95] Two days later, the union permanently barred him.[96]\\n\\nTrump acquired his style of politics from professional wrestling[97]—with its staged fights and name-calling.[98] Author Naomi Klein writes he is a member of the WWE Hall of Fame for his performances \"as himself (the ultrarich boss) in World Wrestling Entertainment\".[99]\\n\\nThe Apprentice and The Celebrity Apprentice\\nMain articles: The Apprentice (American TV series) and The Celebrity Apprentice\\nProducer Mark Burnett made Trump a television star[100] when he created The Apprentice, which Trump hosted from 2004 to 2015 (including variant The Celebrity Apprentice). On the shows, he was a superrich chief executive who eliminated contestants with the catchphrase \"you\\'re fired\". The New York Times called his portrayal \"a highly flattering, highly fictionalized version\" of himself.[101] The shows remade Trump\\'s image for millions of viewers nationwide.[101][102] With the related licensing agreements, they earned him more than $400 million.[103]\\n\\nEarly political aspirations\\nFurther information: Political career of Donald Trump\\nTrump registered as a Republican in 1987;[104] a member of the Independence Party, the New York state affiliate of the Reform Party, in 1999;[105] a Democrat in 2001; a Republican in 2009; unaffiliated in 2011; and a Republican in 2012.[104]\\n\\nTrump, leaning heavily onto a lectern, with his mouth open mid-speech and a woman clapping politely next to him\\nTrump speaking at CPAC, 2011\\nIn 1987, Trump placed full-page advertisements in major newspapers[106] expressing his views on foreign policy and how to eliminate the federal budget deficit.[107] In 1988, he approached Lee Atwater, asking to be put into consideration to be Republican nominee George H. W. Bush\\'s running mate. Bush found the request \"strange and unbelievable\".[108][109] Trump was a candidate in the 2000 Reform Party presidential primaries for three months before he withdrew in February 2000.[110][111][112] In 2011, Trump considered challenging President Barack Obama in the 2012 election. He spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February and gave speeches in states with early primaries.[113][114] In May 2011, he announced that he would not run.[113]\\n\\n2016 presidential election\\nMain article: Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign\\nFurther information: 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries, 2016 United States presidential election, and First presidential transition of Donald Trump\\nTrump announced his candidacy for the 2016 election in June 2015.[115][116] He became the Republican front-runner in March 2016[117] and was declared the presumptive Republican nominee in May.[118] His campaign statements were often opaque and suggestive,[119] and a record number were false.[120][121][122] He was highly critical of media coverage and frequently made claims of media bias.[123][124] Hillary Clinton led Trump in national polling averages throughout the campaign, but her lead narrowed in early July.[125] In mid-July, he selected Indiana governor Mike Pence as his running mate,[126] and the two were officially nominated at the 2016 Republican National Convention.[127] Trump and Clinton participated in three presidential debates in September and October 2016. He twice refused to say whether he would accept the result of the election.[128]\\n\\nTrump speaking in front of an American flag behind a lectern, wearing a black suit and red hat. The lectern sports a blue \"TRUMP\" sign.\\nTrump campaigning in Arizona, March 2016\\nTrump described NATO as \"obsolete\"[129][130] and espoused views that were described as noninterventionist and protectionist.[131] His campaign platform emphasized renegotiating U.S.–China relations and free trade agreements such as NAFTA and strongly enforcing immigration laws. Other campaign positions included pursuing energy independence while opposing climate change regulations, modernizing services for veterans, repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, abolishing Common Core education standards, investing in infrastructure, simplifying the tax code while reducing taxes, and imposing tariffs on imports by companies that offshore jobs. He advocated increasing military spending and extreme vetting or banning of immigrants from Muslim-majority countries.[132] Trump\\'s proposed immigration policies were a topic of bitter debate during the 2016 campaign. He promised to build a wall on the Mexico–U.S. border to restrict illegal movement and vowed that Mexico would pay for it.[133] He pledged to deport millions of illegal immigrants residing in the U.S.,[134] and criticized birthright citizenship for incentivizing \"anchor babies\".[135] According to an analysis in Political Science Quarterly, Trump made \"explicitly racist and sexist appeals to win over white voters\" during his 2016 presidential campaign.[136] In particular, his campaign launch speech drew criticism for claiming Mexican immigrants were \"bringing drugs, they\\'re bringing crime, they\\'re rapists\";[137] in response, NBC fired him from Celebrity Apprentice.[138]\\n\\nTrump\\'s FEC-required reports listed assets above $1.4 billion and outstanding debts of at least $315 million.[139][140] He did not release his tax returns, contrary to the practice of every major candidate since 1976 and his promises in 2014 and 2015 to do so if he ran for office.[141][142] He said his tax returns were being audited, and that his lawyers had advised him against releasing them.[143] After a lengthy court battle to block release of his tax returns and other records to the Manhattan district attorney for a criminal investigation, including two appeals by Trump to the U.S. Supreme Court, in February 2021 the high court allowed the records to be released to the prosecutor for review by a grand jury.[144][145] In October 2016, portions of Trump\\'s state filings for 1995 were leaked to a reporter from The New York Times. They show that he had declared a loss of $916 million that year, which could have let him avoid taxes for up to 18 years.[146]\\n\\nOn November 8, 2016, Trump received 306 pledged electoral votes versus 232 for Clinton. After elector defections on both sides, the official count was 304 to 227.[147] The fifth person to be elected president despite losing the popular vote,[c] he received nearly 2.9 million fewer votes than Clinton, 46.3% to her 48.25%.[148] He was the only president who neither served in the military nor held any government office prior to becoming president.[149] His victory marked the return of an undivided Republican government—a Republican president combined with Republican control of both chambers of Congress.[150] Trump\\'s victory sparked protests in major U.S. cities.[151][152]\\n\\nFirst presidency (2017–2021)\\nMain article: First presidency of Donald Trump\\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of the Donald Trump presidencies.\\nTrump, with his family watching, raises his right hand and places his left hand on the Bible as he takes the oath of office.

The day after his inauguration, an estimated 2.6 million people worldwide, including 500,000 in Washington, D.C., protested against him in the Women\\'s Marches.[153] During his first week in office, Trump signed six executive orders, including authorizing procedures for repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\"Obamacare\"), withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations, advancement of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access Pipeline projects, and planning for a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.[154]\\n\\nConflicts of interest\\nSee also: First presidency of Donald Trump § Ethics\\nBefore being inaugurated, Trump moved his businesses into a revocable trust,[155][156] rather than a blind trust or equivalent arrangement \"to cleanly sever himself from his business interests\".[157] He continued to profit from his businesses and knew how his administration\\'s policies affected them.[156][158] Although he said he would eschew \"new foreign deals\", the Trump Organization pursued operational expansions in Scotland, Dubai, and the Dominican Republic.[156][158] Lobbyists, foreign government officials, and Trump donors and allies generated hundreds of millions of dollars for his resorts and hotels.[159] Trump was sued for violating the Domestic and Foreign Emoluments Clauses of the U.S. Constitution, the first time that the clauses had been substantively litigated.[160] One case was dismissed in lower court.[161] Two were dismissed by the U.S. Supreme Court as moot after his term.[162]\\n\\nDomestic policy\\nMain articles: Economic policy of the first Donald Trump administration, Environmental policy of the first Donald Trump administration, and Social policy of the first Donald Trump administration\\nTrump took office at the height of the longest economic expansion in American history,[163] which began in 2009 and continued until February 2020, when the COVID-19 recession began.[164] In December 2017, he signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. It reduced tax rates for businesses and individuals and eliminated the penalty associated with the Affordable Care Act\\'s individual mandate.[165][166] The Trump administration claimed that the act would not decrease government revenue, but 2018 revenues were 7.6 percent lower than projected.[167] Under Trump, the federal budget deficit increased by almost 50 percent, to nearly $1 trillion in 2019.[168] By the end of his term, the U.S. national debt increased by 39 percent, reaching $27.75 trillion, and the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio hit a post–World War II high.[169] Trump also failed to deliver the $1 trillion infrastructure spending plan on which he had campaigned.[170]\\n\\nTrump is the only modern U.S. president to leave office with a smaller workforce than when he took office, by three million people.[163][171] He rejects the scientific consensus on climate change.[172][173][174][175] He reduced the budget for renewable energy research by 40 percent and reversed Obama-era policies directed at curbing climate change.[176] He withdrew from the Paris Agreement, making the U.S. the only nation to not ratify it.[177] He aimed to boost the production and exports of fossil fuels.[178][179] Natural gas expanded under Trump, but coal continued to decline.[180][181] He rolled back more than 100 federal environmental regulations, including those that curbed greenhouse gas emissions, air and water pollution, and the use of toxic substances. He weakened protections for animals and environmental standards for federal infrastructure projects, and expanded permitted areas for drilling and resource extraction, such as allowing drilling in the Arctic Refuge.[182]\\n\\nTrump dismantled federal regulations on health,[183][184] labor,[184] the environment,[185][184] and other areas, including a bill that made it easier for severely mentally ill persons to buy guns.[186] During his first six weeks in office, he delayed, suspended, or reversed ninety federal regulations,[187] often \"after requests by the regulated industries\".[188] The Institute for Policy Integrity found that 78 percent of his proposals were blocked by courts or did not prevail over litigation.[189] During his campaign, Trump vowed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.[190] In office, he scaled back the Act\\'s implementation through executive orders.[191][192] He expressed a desire to \"let Obamacare fail\"; his administration halved the enrollment period and drastically reduced funding for enrollment promotion.[193][194] In June 2018, the Trump administration joined 18 Republican-led states in arguing before the Supreme Court that the elimination of the financial penalties associated with the individual mandate had rendered the Act unconstitutional.[195][196] Their pleading would have eliminated health insurance coverage for up to 23 million Americans, but was unsuccessful.[195] During the 2016 campaign, Trump promised to protect funding for Medicare and other social safety-net programs. In January 2020, he expressed willingness to consider cuts to them.[197]\\n\\nIn response to the opioid epidemic, Trump signed legislation in 2018 to increase funding for drug treatments, but was widely criticized for failing to make a concrete strategy.[198] He barred organizations that provide abortions or abortion referrals from receiving federal funds.[199] He said he supported \"traditional marriage\", but considered the nationwide legality of same-sex marriage \"settled\".[200] His administration rolled back key components of the Obama administration\\'s workplace protections against discrimination of LGBTQ people.[201] His attempted rollback of anti-discrimination protections for transgender patients in August 2020 was halted by a federal judge after a Supreme Court ruling extended employees\\' civil rights protections to gender identity and sexual orientation.[202] Trump has said he is opposed to gun control, although his views have shifted over time.[203] His administration took an anti-marijuana position, revoking Obama-era policies that provided protections for states that legalized marijuana.[204] He is a long-time advocate of capital punishment,[205][206] and his administration oversaw the federal government execute 13 prisoners, more than in the previous 56 years combined, ending a 17-year moratorium.[207] In 2016, he said he supported the use of interrogation torture methods such as waterboarding.[208][209]\\n\\nRace relations\\nTrump\\'s comments on the 2017 Unite the Right rally, condemning \"this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides\" and stating that there were \"very fine people on both sides\", were criticized as implying a moral equivalence between the white supremacist demonstrators and the counter-protesters.[210] In a January 2018 discussion of immigration legislation, he reportedly referred to El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, and African nations as \"shithole countries\".[211] His remarks were condemned as racist.[212]\\n\\n\\nTrump and group of officials and advisors on the way from the White House to St. John\\'s Church\\nIn July 2019, Trump tweeted that four Democratic congresswomen—all minorities, three of whom are native-born Americans—should \"go back\" to the countries they \"came from\".[213] Two days later the House of Representatives voted 240–187, mostly along party lines, to condemn his \"racist comments\".[214] White nationalist publications and social media praised his remarks, which continued over the following days.[215] He continued to make similar remarks during his 2020 campaign.[216] In June 2020, during the George Floyd protests, federal law-enforcement officials controversially removed a largely peaceful crowd of lawful protesters from Lafayette Square, outside the White House.[217][218] Trump then posed with a Bible for a photo-op at the nearby St. John\\'s Episcopal Church,[217][219][220] with religious leaders condemning both the treatment of protesters and the photo opportunity itself.[221] Many retired military leaders and defense officials condemned his proposal to use the U.S. military against anti-police-brutality protesters.[222]\\n\\nPardons and commutations\\nFurther information: List of people granted executive clemency by Donald Trump\\nTrump granted 237 requests for clemency, fewer than all presidents since 1900 with the exception of George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush.[223] Only 25 of them had been vetted by the Justice Department\\'s Office of the Pardon Attorney; the others were granted to people with personal or political connections to him, his family, and his allies, or recommended by celebrities.[224][225] In his last full day in office, he granted 73 pardons and commuted 70 sentences.[226] Several Trump allies were not eligible for pardons under Justice Department rules, and in other cases the department had opposed clemency.[224] The pardons of three military service members convicted of or charged with violent crimes were opposed by military leaders.[227]\\n\\nImmigration\\nMain articles: Immigration policy of the first Donald Trump administration and Mexico–United States border crisis § First Trump administration (2017–2021)\\nFurther information: Trump travel ban, Trump administration family separation policy, and Mexico–United States border wall § First Trump administration (2017–2021)\\nTrump is speaking with U.S. Border Patrol agents. Behind him are black SUVs, four short border wall prototype designs, and the current border wall in the background.\\nTrump examines border wall prototypes in Otay Mesa, California.\\nAs president, Trump described illegal immigration as an \"invasion\" of the United States[228] and drastically escalated immigration enforcement.[229][230] He implemented harsh policies against asylum seekers[230] and deployed nearly 6,000 troops the U.S.–Mexico border to stop illegal crossings.[231] He reduced the number of refugees admitted to record lows, from an annual limit of 110,000 before he took office to 15,000 in 2021.[232][233][234] Trump also increased restrictions on granting permanent residency to immigrants needing public benefits.[235] One of his central campaign promises was to build a wall along the U.S.–Mexico border;[236] during his first term, the U.S. built 73 miles (117 km) of wall in areas without barriers and 365 miles (587 km) to replace older barriers.[237] In 2018, Trump\\'s refusal to sign any congressional spending bill unless it allocated funding for the border wall[238] resulted in the longest-ever federal government shutdown, for 35 days from December 2018 to January 2019.[239][240] The shutdown ended after he agreed to fund the government without any funds for the wall.[239] To avoid another shutdown, Congress passed a funding bill with $1.4 billion for border fencing in February.[241] Trump later declared a national emergency on the southern border to divert $6.1 billion of funding to the border wall[241] despite congressional disagreement.[242]\\n\\nIn January 2017, Trump signed an executive order that temporarily denied entry to citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries.[243][244] The order caused many protests and legal challenges that resulted in nationwide injunctions.[243][244][245] A revised order giving some exceptions was also blocked by courts,[246][247] but the Supreme Court ruled in June that the ban could be enforced on those lacking \"a bona fide relationship with a person or entity\" in the U.S.[248] Trump replaced the ban in September with a presidential proclamation extending travel bans to North Koreans, Chadians, and some Venezuelan officials, but excluded Iraq and Sudan.[249] The Supreme Court allowed that version to go into effect in December 2017,[250] and ultimately upheld the ban in 2019.[251] From 2017 to 2018, the Trump administration had a policy of family separation that separated over 4,400 children of migrant families from their parents at the U.S.–Mexico border,[252][253] an unprecedented[254] policy sparked public outrage in the country.[255] Despite Trump initially blaming Democrats[256][257] and insisting he could not stop the policy with an executive order, he acceded to public pressure in June 2018 and mandated that migrant families be detained together unless \"there is a concern\" of risk for the child.[258][259] A judge later ordered that the families be reunited and further separations stopped except in limited circumstances,[260][261] though over 1,000 additional children were separated from their families after the order.[253]\\n\\nForeign policy\\nMain articles: Foreign policy of the first Donald Trump administration and First Trump tariffs\\nFurther information: Russia–United States relations § First Trump administration (2017–2021), China–United States relations § First Trump administration (2017–2021), 2017–2018 North Korea crisis, and 2018–19 Korean peace process\\nSee also: List of international presidential trips made by Donald Trump § First presidency (2017–2021)\\nTrump and other G7 leaders sit at a conference table\\nTrump with the other G7 leaders at the 45th summit in France, 2019\\nTrump described himself as a \"nationalist\"[262] and his foreign policy as \"America First\".[263] He supported populist, neo-nationalist, and authoritarian governments.[264] Unpredictability, uncertainty, and inconsistency characterized foreign relations during his tenure.[263][265] Relations between the U.S. and its European allies were strained under Trump.[266] He criticized NATO allies and privately suggested that the U.S. should withdraw from NATO.[267][268] Trump supported many of the policies of Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu.[269] In 2020, Trump hosted the signing of the Abraham Accords between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain to normalize their foreign relations.[270]\\n\\nTrump began a trade war with China in 2018 after imposing tariffs and other trade barriers he said would force China to end longstanding unfair trade practice and intellectual property theft.[271] Trump weakened the toughest U.S. sanctions imposed after Russia\\'s 2014 annexation of Crimea.[272][273] Trump praised and, according to some critics, rarely criticized Russian president Vladimir Putin,[274][275] though he opposed some actions of Russia\\'s government.[276] He withdrew the U.S. from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, citing alleged Russian noncompliance,[277] and supported Russia\\'s possible return to the G7.[278] As North Korea\\'s nuclear weapons were increasingly seen as a serious threat,[279] Trump became the first sitting U.S. president to meet a North Korean leader, meeting Kim Jong Un three times: in Singapore in June 2018, in Hanoi in February 2019, and in the Korean Demilitarized Zone in June 2019.[280] Talks in October 2019 broke down[281] and no denuclearization agreement was reached.[282]\\n\\nPersonnel\\nMain articles: Political appointments of the first Trump administration and First cabinet of Donald Trump\\nBy the end of Trump\\'s first year in office, 34 percent of his original staff had resigned, been fired, or been reassigned.[283] As of early July 2018, 61 percent of his senior aides had left[284] and 141 staffers had left in the previous year.[285] Both figures set a record for recent presidents.[286] Close personal aides to Trump quit or were forced out.[287] He publicly disparaged several of his former top officials.[288]\\n\\nTrump had four White House chiefs of staff, marginalizing or pushing out several.[289] In May 2017, he dismissed FBI director James Comey, saying a few days later that he was concerned about Comey\\'s role in the Trump–Russia investigations.[290][291]. Three of Trump\\'s 15 original cabinet members left or were forced to resign within his first year.[292][287] Trump was slow to appoint second-tier officials in the executive branch, saying many of the positions are unnecessary. In October 2017, there were hundreds of sub-cabinet positions without a nominee.[293] By January 8, 2019, of 706 key positions, 433 had been filled and he had no nominee for 264.[294]\\n\\nJudiciary\\nFurther information: List of federal judges appointed by Donald Trump and Donald Trump judicial appointment controversies\\nTrump appointed 226 federal judges, including 54 to the courts of appeals and three to the Supreme Court: Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett.[295] His Supreme Court appointments politically shifted the Court to the right.[296][297][298] In the 2016 campaign, he pledged that Roe v. Wade would be overturned \"automatically\" if he were elected and given the opportunity to appoint two or three anti-abortion justices. He later took credit when Roe was overturned by Dobbs v. Jackson Women\\'s Health Organization in 2022; all three of his Supreme Court nominees voted with the majority.[299][300] Trump disparaged courts and judges he disagreed with, often in personal terms, and questioned the judiciary\\'s constitutional authority. His attacks on courts drew rebukes from observers, including sitting federal judges, concerned about the effect of his statements on the judicial independence and public confidence in the judiciary.[301][302]\\n\\nCOVID-19 pandemic\\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in the United States\\nFurther information: U.S. federal government response to the COVID-19 pandemic and Communication of the Trump administration during the COVID-19 pandemic\\nSee also: Economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States\\nTrump speaks in the West Wing briefing room with various officials standing behind him, all in formal attire and without face masks\\nTrump conducts a COVID-19 press briefing with members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force on March 15, 2020.\\nTrump initially ignored public health warnings and calls for action from health officials within his administration.[303] Trump established the White House Coronavirus Task Force on January 29.[304] On March 27, he signed into law the CARES Act—a $2.2 trillion bipartisan economic stimulus bill—the largest stimulus in U.S. history.[305][306] After weeks of attacks to draw attention away from his slow response, Trump halted funding of the World Health Organization in April.[307] In April 2020, Republican-connected groups organized anti-lockdown protests against the measures state governments were taking to combat the pandemic;[308][309] Trump encouraged the protests on Twitter,[310] although the targeted states did not meet his administration\\'s guidelines for reopening.[311] He repeatedly pressured federal health agencies to take actions he favored,[312] such as approving unproven treatments.[313][314] In October, Trump was hospitalized for three days with a severe case of COVID-19.[315]\\n\\nInvestigations\\nFurther information: Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, Mueller special counsel investigation, and Mueller report\\nAfter he assumed office, Trump was the subject of increasing Justice Department and congressional scrutiny, with investigations covering his election campaign, transition, and inauguration, actions taken during his presidency, his private businesses, personal taxes, and charitable foundation.[316] There were ten federal criminal investigations, eight state and local investigations, and twelve congressional investigations.[317]\\n\\nIn July 2016, the FBI launched Crossfire Hurricane, an investigation into possible links between Russia and Trump\\'s 2016 campaign.[318] After Trump fired Comey in May 2017, the FBI opened a second investigation into Trump\\'s personal and business dealings with Russia.[319] In January 2017, three U.S. intelligence agencies jointly stated with \"high confidence\" that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election to favor Trump.[320][321] Many suspicious[322] links between Trump associates and Russian officials were discovered.[323][324][325] Trump told Russian officials he was unconcerned about Russia\\'s election interference.[326] Crossfire Hurricane was later transferred to Robert Mueller\\'s special counsel investigation;[327] the investigation into Trump\\'s ties to Russia was ended by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein after he told the FBI that Mueller would pursue the matter.[328][329] At the request of Rosenstein, the Mueller investigation examined criminal matters \"in connection with Russia\\'s 2016 election interference\".[328] Mueller submitted his final report in March 2019.[330] The report found that Russia did interfere in 2016 to favor Trump[331] and that Trump and his campaign welcomed and encouraged the effort,[332][333][334] but that the evidence \"did not establish\" that Trump campaign members conspired or coordinated with Russia.[335][336] Trump claimed the report exonerated him despite Mueller writing that it did not.[337] The report also detailed potential obstruction of justice by Trump but \"did not draw ultimate conclusions\"[338][339] and left the decision to charge the laws to Congress.[340]\\n\\nIn April 2019, the House Oversight Committee issued subpoenas seeking financial details from Trump\\'s banks, Deutsche Bank and Capital One, and his accounting firm, Mazars USA. He sued the banks, Mazars, and committee chair Elijah Cummings to prevent the disclosures.[341] In May, two judges ruled that both Mazars and the banks must comply with the subpoenas;[342][343][344] Trump\\'s attorneys appealed.[345] In September 2022, Trump and the committee agreed to a settlement regarding Mazars, and the firm began turning over documents.[346]\\n\\nImpeachments\\nMain articles: First impeachment of Donald Trump and Second impeachment of Donald Trump\\n\\nTrump displaying the headline \"Trump acquitted\" in 2020\\nTrump was impeached twice by the House of Representatives during his first presidential term, though acquitted by the Senate on both occasions. The first impeachment arose from a whistleblower complaint that in 2019 Trump had pressured Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden,[347] in an attempt to gain an advantage in the 2020 presidential election.[348] In December 2019, the House voted to impeach Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress,[349] and the Senate acquitted him in February 2020.[350] The second impeachment came after the January 6 attack, for which the House charged Trump with incitement of insurrection on January 13, 2021.[351] Trump left office on January 20 and was acquitted on February 13. Seven Republican senators voted for conviction.[352]\\n\\n2020 presidential election\\nFurther information: 2020 United States presidential election\\nPresidential campaign\\nMain article: Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign\\nTrump filed to run for reelection only a few hours after becoming president in 2017.[353] He held his first reelection rally less than a month after taking office[354] and officially became the Republican nominee in August 2020.[355] Trump\\'s campaign focused on crime, claiming that cities would descend into lawlessness if Democratic nominee Joe Biden won.[356] He repeatedly misrepresented Biden\\'s positions[357][358] and appealed to racism.[359] Starting in early 2020, Trump sowed doubts about the election, claiming without evidence that it would be rigged and that widespread use of mail balloting would produce massive election fraud.[360][361] He blocked funding for the U.S. Postal Service, saying he wanted to prevent any increase in voting by mail.[362] He repeatedly refused to say whether he would accept the results if he lost and commit to a peaceful transition of power.[363][364]\\n\\nLoss to Biden and rejection of outcome\\nFurther information: Attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election and 2020–21 United States election protests\\nBiden won the November 2020 election, receiving 81.3 million votes (51.3 percent) to Trump\\'s 74.2 million (46.8 percent)[365][366] and 306 electoral votes to Trump\\'s 232.[367] The Electoral College formalized Biden\\'s victory on December 14.[367] Even before the results were known on the morning after the election, Trump declared victory.[368] Days later, when Biden was projected the winner, Trump baselessly alleged election fraud.[369] As part of an effort to overturn the results, Trump and his allies filed many legal challenges to the results, which were rejected by at least 86 judges in both state and federal courts for having no factual or legal basis.[370][371]\\n\\nTrump\\'s allegations were also refuted by state election officials,[372] and the Supreme Court declined to hear a case asking it to overturn the results in four states won by Biden.[373] Trump repeatedly sought help to overturn the results, personally pressuring Republican local and state office-holders,[374] Republican legislators,[375] the Justice Department,[376] and Vice President Pence,[377] urging various actions such as replacing presidential electors, or requesting that Georgia officials \"find\" votes and announce a \"recalculated\" result.[375] In the weeks after the election, Trump withdrew from public activities.[378] He initially blocked government officials from cooperating in Biden\\'s presidential transition.[379][380] After three weeks, the administrator of the General Services Administration declared Biden the \"apparent winner\" of the election, allowing the disbursement of transition resources to his team.[381] While Trump said he recommended that the GSA begin transition protocols, he still did not formally concede.[382][383] Trump did not attend Biden\\'s inauguration on January 20.[384]\\n\\nJanuary 6 Capitol attack\\nMain article: January 6 United States Capitol attack\\n\\nA crowd of Trump supporters during the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol in 2021\\nIn December 2020, reports emerged that the U.S. military was on \"red alert\", and ranking officers had discussed what to do if Trump declared martial law.[385] Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Mark Milley and CIA director Gina Haspel grew concerned that Trump would attempt a coup or military action against China or Iran.[386][387] Milley insisted that he be consulted about any military orders from Trump, including the use of nuclear weapons.[388][389]\\n\\nAt noon on January 6, 2021, while Congress was certifying the presidential election results at the U.S. Capitol, Trump held a rally at the Ellipse in Washington, D.C., where he called for the election to be overturned and urged his supporters to \"fight like hell\" and \"take back our country\" by marching to the Capitol.[390] His supporters then formed a mob that broke into the building, disrupting certification and causing the evacuation of Congress.[391] During the attack, Trump posted on social media but did not ask the rioters to disperse until 6 p.m., when he told them in a tweet to \"go home with love & in peace\" while calling them \"great patriots\" and restating that he had won the election.[392] Congress later reconvened and confirmed Biden\\'s victory in the early hours of January 7.[393] More than 140 police officers were injured, and five people died either during or after the attack.[394][395] The event has been described as an attempted self-coup by Trump.[d]\\n\\nBetween terms (2021–2025)\\nSee also: Personal and business legal affairs of Donald Trump and Legal affairs of Donald Trump as president\\nUpon leaving the White House, Trump began living at Mar-a-Lago, establishing an office there as provided for by the Former Presidents Act.[399] His continuing false claims concerning the 2020 election were commonly referred to as the \"big lie\" by his critics, although in May 2021, with his supporters he began using the term to refer to the election itself.[400][401] The Republican Party used his election narrative to justify imposing new voting restrictions in its favor.[402][403][404] As of July 2022, he continued to pressure state legislators to overturn the election.[405] Unlike other former presidents, Trump continued to dominate his party; a 2022 profile in The New York Times described him as a modern party boss.[406] He continued fundraising, raising a war chest containing more than twice that of the Republican Party, and profited from fundraisers many Republican candidates held at Mar-a-Lago. Much of his focus was on party governance and installing in key posts officials loyal to him.[406] In the 2022 midterm elections, he endorsed over 200 candidates for various offices.[407] In February 2021, he registered a new company, Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), for providing \"social networking services\" to U.S. customers.[408][409] In March 2024, TMTG merged with special-purpose acquisition company Digital World Acquisition and became a public company.[410] In February 2022, TMTG launched Truth Social, a social media platform.[411]\\n\\nIn 2019, journalist E. Jean Carroll accused Trump of raping her in the 1990s and sued him for defamation over his denial.[412] Carroll sued him again in 2022 for battery and more defamation.[413] He was found liable for sexual abuse and defamation and ordered to pay $5 million in one case[414] and $83.3 million in the other.[414][415] In 2022, New York filed a civil lawsuit against Trump accusing him of inflating the Trump Organization\\'s value to gain an advantage with lenders and banks;[416][417] He was found liable and ordered to pay $350 million plus interest.[417]\\n\\n\\nClassified intelligence material found during search of Mar-a-Lago\\nIn connection with Trump\\'s efforts to overturn the 2020 election and his involvement in the January 6 attack, in December 2022 the U.S. House committee on the attack recommended criminal charges against him for obstructing an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the United States, and inciting or assisting an insurrection.[418] In August 2023, he was indicted on 13 charges, including racketeering, by a grand jury in Fulton County, Georgia for his efforts to subvert the 2020 election in the state.[419][420]\\n\\nIn January 2022, the National Archives and Records Administration retrieved 15 boxes of documents Trump had taken to Mar-a-Lago after leaving the White House, some of which were classified.[421] In the ensuing Justice Department investigation, officials retrieved more classified documents from his lawyers.[421] On August 8, 2022, FBI agents searched Mar-a-Lago for illegally held documents, including those in breach of the Espionage Act, collecting 11 sets of classified documents, some marked top secret.[422][423] A federal grand jury constituted by Special Counsel Jack Smith indicted Trump in June 2023 on 31 counts of \"willfully retaining national defense information\" under the Espionage Act, among other charges.[421][424][425] Trump pleaded not guilty.[426] In July 2024, judge Aileen Cannon dismissed the case, ruling Smith\\'s appointment as special prosecutor was unconstitutional.[427]\\n\\nIn May 2024, Trump was convicted on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.[428] The case stemmed from evidence that he booked Michael Cohen\\'s hush-money payments to adult film actress Stormy Daniels as business expenses to cover up his alleged 2006–2007 affair with Daniels during the 2016 election.[428][429] On January 10, 2025, the judge gave Trump a no-penalty sentence known as an unconditional discharge, saying that punitive requirements would have interfered with presidential immunity.[430] After his reelection, the 2020 election obstruction case and the classified documents case were dismissed without prejudice due to Justice Department policy against prosecuting sitting presidents.[431]\\n\\n2024 presidential election\\nMain article: Donald Trump 2024 presidential campaign\\nFurther information: 2024 Republican Party presidential primaries, 2024 United States presidential election, and Second presidential transition of Donald Trump\\n\\nTrump at a rally in Arizona, August 2024\\nIn November 2022, Trump announced his candidacy for the 2024 presidential election and created a fundraising account.[432][433] In March 2023, the campaign began diverting 10 percent of the donations to his leadership PAC. His campaign had paid $100 million towards his legal bills by March 2024.[434][435] In December 2023, the Colorado Supreme Court ruled him disqualified for the Colorado Republican primary for his role in inciting the January 6, 2021, attack on Congress. In March 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court restored his name to the ballot in a unanimous decision, ruling that Colorado lacks the authority to enforce Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which bars insurrectionists from holding federal office.[436]\\n\\nDuring the campaign, Trump made increasingly violent and authoritarian statements.[437][438][439][440] He said that he would weaponize the FBI and the Justice Department against his political opponents[441][442] and use the military to target Democratic politicians and those that do not support his candidacy.[443][444] He used harsher, more dehumanizing anti-immigrant rhetoric than during his presidency.[445][446][447][448] His harsher rhetoric against his political enemies has been described by some historians and scholars as authoritarian, fascist,[e] and unlike anything a political candidate has ever said in American history.[453][444][454] Age and health concerns also arose during the campaign, with several medical experts highlighting an increase in rambling, tangential speech and behavioral disinhibition.[455]\\n\\nTrump mentioned \"rigged election\" and \"election interference\" earlier and more frequently than in the 2016 and 2020 campaigns and refused to commit to accepting the 2024 election results.[456][457] Analysts for The New York Times described this as an intensification of his \"heads I win; tails you cheated\" rhetorical strategy; the newspaper said the claim of a rigged election had become the backbone of the campaign.[457]\\n\\nOn July 13, 2024, Trump was shot in the ear in an assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Butler Township, Pennsylvania.[458][459][460] Two days later, the 2024 Republican National Convention nominated him as their presidential candidate, with Senator JD Vance as his running mate.[461] In September, he was targeted in another assassination attempt in Florida.[462]\\n\\nTrump won the election in November 2024 with 312 electoral votes to incumbent vice president Kamala Harris\\'s 226,[463] making him the second president in U.S. history to be elected to a nonconsecutive second term.[464] He also won the popular vote with 49.8% to Harris\\'s 48.3%.[465] His victory in 2024 was part of a global backlash against incumbent parties,[466][467] in part due to the 2021–2023 inflation surge.[468][469] Several outlets described his reelection as an extraordinary comeback.[470][471]\\n\\nSecond presidency (2025–present)\\nMain article: Second presidency of Donald Trump\\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of the Donald Trump presidencies.\\n\\nTrump taking the oath of office, administered by Chief Justice John Roberts, January 20, 2025.\\nTrump began his second term upon his inauguration on January 20, 2025.[472] He became the oldest individual to assume the presidency[473] and the first president with a felony conviction.[474]\\n\\nEarly actions, 2025–present\\nSee also: Second presidential transition of Donald Trump and First 100 days of the second Donald Trump presidency\\nUpon taking office, Trump signed a series of executive orders that tested the limits of executive authority. Many drew immediate legal challenges.[475] He issued more executive orders on his first day than any other president.[476] Four days into his second term, analysis conducted by Time found that nearly two-thirds of his executive actions \"mirror or partially mirror\" proposals from Project 2025.[477] He pardoned around 1,500 January 6 rioters, including those who violently attacked police, and commuted the sentences of 14.[478] In his first weeks, several of his actions have ignored or violated federal laws, regulations, and the Constitution according to American legal scholars.[479][480][481] In his administration\\'s first month, Trump issued ninety executive orders, memorandums, and directives.[482] By March 7, his orders and actions on immigration, firing commissioners and watchdogs, downsizing the federal workforce, and others had been challenged by over 100 lawsuits nationwide.[483]\\n\\nMass terminations of federal employees\\nMain article: 2025 United States federal mass layoffs\\nTrump implemented a hiring freeze across the federal government and ordered telework of federal employees to be discontinued within 30 days.[484][485] He ordered a review of many career civil service positions with the intention of reclassifying them into at-will positions without job protections.[485][486][487] He initiated mass job terminations of federal employees,[488] which were described by legal experts as unprecedented or in violation of federal law,[489] with the intent of replacing them with workers more aligned with his agenda.[490] By late February, the administration had fired more than 30,000 people.[491] He ordered an end to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) projects in the federal government and placed employees in DEI offices on leave. He rescinded Executive Order 11246, which mandated affirmative action and nondiscrimination practices for federal contractors.[492][493]\\n\\nTrump and Elon Musk are attempting to dismantle most of USAID.[494] After a restraining order expired in late February, Trump put 2,000 employees on administrative leave.[495]\\n\\nDomestic policy, 2025–present\\nSee also: Second presidency of Donald Trump § Economy\\nTrump appointed oil, gas, and chemical lobbyists to the EPA to reverse climate regulations and pollution controls.[496] He declared a national energy emergency, allowing the suspension of environmental regulations, loosening the rules for fossil fuel extraction and limiting renewable energy projects.[497][498] He initiated a review of the \"legality and continued applicability\" of the EPA endangerment finding, which is the basis of most federal regulations on greenhouse gases,[499] and again withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Agreement on climate change.[500]\\n\\nTrump frequently blamed diversity, equity, and inclusion and wokeness for problems in government and society, and equated diversity with incompetence.[501] He repealed and reversed pro-diversity policies in the federal government.[502][503] His administration took an aggressive approach against what it called \"gender ideology\", ending the ability to change the gender listed on passports, halting federal funding to entities providing gender-affirming care to people under 19, banning transgender people from the military, and preventing transgender women from competing in women\\'s sports programs at institutions that receive federal funding.[504][505]\\n\\nImmigration, 2025–present\\nMain articles: Immigration policy of the second Donald Trump administration and Mexico–United States border crisis § Second Trump administration (2025–present)\\nFurther information: Deportation of illegal immigrants in the second presidency of Donald Trump and Mexico–United States border wall § Second Trump administration (2025–present)\\nIn his first days in office, Trump instructed border patrol agents to summarily deport migrants crossing the border, disabled the CBP One app that was being used to schedule border crossings, resumed the remain in Mexico policy, designated drug cartels as terrorist groups, and ordered construction to be resumed on a border wall.[506][507] The number of illegal crossings had been dropping since early 2024. In February 2025, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) apprehensions were at the lowest level since monthly data became available in 2000.[508][509]\\n\\nTrump sought to implement mass deportations, with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) setting a goal of 1,200 to 1,500 daily arrests. However, actual numbers of arrests have lagged these goals and the rates of arrests under the Obama and Biden administrations.[510][511][512] Trump initially focused deportation operations in sanctuary cities and against individuals on \"target lists\" of criminals formed prior to the Trump administration. Removals were also expedited for asylum applicants who failed to meet requirements.[513][514][515] Trump revoked the parole status of migrants who entered the U.S. under CBP One and CHNV humanitarian parole.[507][515] He attempted to remove birthright citizenship and suspend the Refugee Admissions Program.[516][517] On January 29, 2025, he signed the Laken Riley Act into law.[518] In March 2025, he attempted to use the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 for the first time since World War II to deport migrants, but was temporarily blocked by a federal judge.[519]\\n\\nForeign policy, 2025–present\\nMain article: Foreign policy of the second Donald Trump administration\\nFurther information: Tariffs in the second Trump administration and American expansionism under Donald Trump\\nTrump\\'s second term foreign policy has been described as imperialist and expansionist,[520][521] and continuing an isolationist \"America First\" foreign policy agenda.[522] His relations with allies were transactional and ranged from indifference to hostility, including threats of annexation.[523][524] He ordered the U.S. government to stop funding and working with the WHO and announced the U.S.\\'s intention to formally leave the WHO.[525][526][527] Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on major trading partners, including China, Canada, and Mexico.[528]\\n\\nTrump and his incoming administration helped broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas alongside the Biden administration, enacted a day prior to his inauguration.[529][530][531] In March, Israel—with the Trump administration\\'s backing—broke the ceasefire.[531]\\n\\nPersonnel, 2025–present\\nMain articles: Second cabinet of Donald Trump and Political appointments of the second Trump administration\\nIn his second term, Trump selected cabinet members with personal loyalty to him, and many appointees lacked relevant experience.[532][533] On February 3, 2025, the White House said that Elon Musk was a special government employee.[534] Trump gave Musk\\'s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) access to many federal government agencies.[534] Musk\\'s teams operated in eighteen departments and agencies in the administration\\'s first month,[535] including in the Treasury Department\\'s $5 trillion payment system,[536] the Small Business Administration, the Office of Personnel Management, and the General Services Administration.[537]\\n\\nJudiciary, 2025–present\\nSee also: List of federal judges appointed by Donald Trump\\nFollowing legal setbacks, Trump increased criticism of the judiciary and called for impeaching federal judges who ruled against him.[538] He threatened, signed executive actions, and ordered investigations into his political opponents, critics, and organizations aligned with the Democratic Party.[539] Trump\\'s defiance of judicial orders and a claimed right to disobey the court raised fears by legal experts of a constitutional crisis.[540]\\n\\nPolitical practice and rhetoric\\nFurther information: Trumpism, Political positions of Donald Trump, and Rhetoric of Donald Trump\\nBeginning with his 2016 campaign, Trump\\'s politics and rhetoric led to the creation of a political movement known as Trumpism.[541] His political positions are populist,[542][543] more specifically described as right-wing populist.[544][545] He helped bring far-right fringe ideas and organizations into the mainstream.[546] Many of his actions and rhetoric have been described as authoritarian and contributing to democratic backsliding.[547][548] Trump pushed for an expansion of presidential power under a maximalist interpretation of the unitary executive theory.[549][550] His political base has been compared to a cult of personality.[f]\\n\\nTrump\\'s rhetoric and actions inflame anger and exacerbate distrust through an \"us\" versus \"them\" narrative.[558] He explicitly and routinely disparages racial, religious, and ethnic minorities,[559] and scholars consistently find that racial animus regarding blacks, immigrants, and Muslims are the best predictors of support for Trump.[560] His rhetoric has been described as using fearmongering and demagogy.[561] The alt-right movement coalesced around and supported his candidacy, due in part to its opposition to multiculturalism and immigration.[562][563][564] He has a strong appeal to evangelical Christian voters and Christian nationalists,[565] and his rallies take on the symbols, rhetoric, and agenda of Christian nationalism.[566]\\n\\nRacial and gender views\\nMany of Trump\\'s comments and actions have been characterized as racist.[567] In a 2018 national poll, about half of respondents said he is racist; a greater proportion believed that he emboldened racists.[568] Several studies and surveys found that racist attitudes fueled his political ascent and were more important than economic factors in determining the allegiance of Trump voters.[569] Racist and Islamophobic attitudes are strong indicators of support for Trump.[570] He has also been accused of racism for insisting a group of five black and Latino teenagers were guilty of raping a white woman in the 1989 Central Park jogger case, even after they were exonerated in 2002 when the actual rapist confessed and his DNA matched the evidence. In 2024, the men sued Trump for defamation after he said in a televised debate that they had committed the crime and killed the woman.[571]\\n\\nTrump answering questions about the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville\\nIn 2011, Trump became the leading proponent of the racist \"birther\" conspiracy theory that Barack Obama, the first black U.S. president, was not born in the United States.[572] He claimed credit for pressuring the government to publish Obama\\'s birth certificate, which he considered fraudulent.[573] He acknowledged that Obama was born in the U.S. in September 2016,[574] though reportedly expressed birther views privately in 2017.[575] During the 2024 presidential campaign, he made false attacks against the racial identity of his opponent, Kamala Harris, that were described as reminiscent of the birther conspiracy theory.[576]\\n\\nTrump has a history of belittling women when speaking to the media and on social media.[577][578] He made lewd comments, disparaged women\\'s physical appearances, and referred to them using derogatory epithets.[578] At least 25 women publicly accused him of sexual misconduct, including rape, kissing without consent, groping, looking under women\\'s skirts, and walking in on naked teenage pageant contestants. He has denied the allegations.[579] In October 2016, a 2005 \"hot mic\" recording surfaced in which he bragged about kissing and groping women without their consent, saying that, \"when you\\'re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. ... Grab \\'em by the pussy.\"[580] He characterized the comments as \"locker-room talk\".[581][582] The incident\\'s widespread media exposure led to his first public apology, videotaped during his 2016 presidential campaign.[583]\\n\\nLink to violence and hate crimes\\nFurther information: Rhetoric of Donald Trump § Violence and dehumanization\\n\\nTrump\\'s refusal to condemn the white supremacist Proud Boys during a 2020 presidential debate[584] and his comment, \"Proud Boys, stand back and stand by\", were attributed to increased recruitment for the pro-Trump group.[585]\\nTrump has been identified as a key figure in increasing political violence in the U.S., both for and against him.[586][587][588] He is described as embracing extremism, conspiracy theories such as Q-Anon, and far-right militia movements to a greater extent than any modern American president,[589][590] and engaging in stochastic terrorism.[591][592]\\n\\nResearch suggests Trump\\'s rhetoric is associated with an increased incidence of hate crimes,[593][594] and that he has an emboldening effect on expressing prejudicial attitudes due to his normalization of explicit racial rhetoric.[595] During his 2016 campaign, he urged or praised physical attacks against protesters or reporters.[596][597] Numerous defendants investigated or prosecuted for violent acts and hate crimes cited his rhetoric in arguing that they were not culpable or should receive leniency.[598][599] A nationwide review by ABC News in May 2020 identified at least 54 criminal cases, from August 2015 to April 2020, in which he was invoked in direct connection with violence or threats of violence mostly by white men and primarily against minorities.[600] Trump\\'s normalization and revisionist history of the January 6 Capitol attack, and grant of clemency to all January 6 rioters, were described by counterterrorism researchers as encouraging future political violence.[601][602]\\n\\nConspiracy theories\\nMain article: List of conspiracy theories promoted by Donald Trump\\nSince before his first presidency, Trump has promoted numerous conspiracy theories, including Obama \"birtherism\", global warming being a hoax, and alleged Ukrainian interference in U.S. elections.[603][604][605] After the 2020 presidential election, he promoted conspiracy theories for his defeat that were characterized as \"the big lie\".[606][607]\\n\\nFalse or misleading statements\\nMain article: False or misleading statements by Donald Trump\\nChart depicting false or misleading claims made by Trump\\nFact-checkers from The Washington Post,[608] the Toronto Star,[609] and CNN[610] compiled data on \"false or misleading claims\" (orange background), and \"false claims\" (violet foreground), respectively.\\nTrump frequently makes false statements in public remarks[611][120] to an extent unprecedented in American politics.[611][612][613] His falsehoods are a distinctive part of his political identity[612] and have been described as firehosing.[614] His false and misleading statements were documented by fact-checkers, including at The Washington Post, which tallied 30,573 false or misleading statements made by him during his first presidency,[608] increasing in frequency over time.[615]\\n\\nSome of Trump\\'s falsehoods were inconsequential,[616][617] while others had more far-reaching effects, such as his unproven promotion of antimalarial drugs as a treatment for COVID-19,[618][619] causing a U.S. shortage of these drugs and panic-buying in Africa and South Asia.[620][621] Other misinformation, such as misattributing a rise in crime in England and Wales to the \"spread of radical Islamic terror\", served his domestic political purposes.[622] His attacks on mail-in ballots and other election practices weakened public faith in the integrity of the 2020 presidential election,[623][624] while his disinformation about the pandemic delayed and weakened the national response to it.[625][626][627] He habitually does not apologize for his falsehoods.[628] Until 2018, the media rarely referred to his falsehoods as lies, including when he repeated demonstrably false statements.[629][630][631]\\n\\nSocial media\\nMain articles: Social media use by Donald Trump and Twitter use by Donald Trump\\nTrump\\'s social media presence attracted worldwide attention after he joined Twitter in 2009. He posted frequently during his 2016 campaign and as president until Twitter banned him after the January 6 attack.[632] He often used Twitter to communicate directly with the public and sideline the press;[633] in 2017, his press secretary said that his tweets constituted official presidential statements.[634]\\n\\nTwitter began attaching fact-checks to tweets in which Trump made false claims in May 2020.[635] In response, he said social media platforms \"totally silence\" conservatives and he would \"strongly regulate, or close them down\".[636] After the January 6 attack, he was banned from Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and other platforms.[637] The loss of his social media presence diminished his ability to shape events[638][639] and correlated with a dramatic decrease in the volume of misinformation on Twitter.[640] In February 2022, he launched social media platform Truth Social where he only attracted a fraction of his Twitter following.[641] Elon Musk, after acquiring Twitter, reinstated his Twitter account in November 2022.[642][643] Meta Platforms\\' two-year ban lapsed in January 2023, allowing him to return to Facebook and Instagram,[644] although in 2024, he continued to call the company an \"enemy of the people\".[645] In January 2025, Meta agreed to pay $25 million to settle a 2021 lawsuit filed by Trump over his suspension.[646]\\n\\nRelationship with the press\\nFurther information: First presidency of Donald Trump § Relationship with the news media, and Personal and business legal affairs of Donald Trump\\nTrump, seated at the Resolute Desk in the White House, speaking to a crowd of reporters with boom microphones in front of him and public officials behind him\\nTrump talking to the press, March 2017\\nTrump sought media attention throughout his career, sustaining a \"love-hate\" relationship with the press.[647] In the 2016 campaign, he benefited from a record amount of free media coverage.[648] As a candidate and as president, he frequently accused the press of bias, calling it the \"fake news media\" and \"the enemy of the people\".[649] The first Trump presidency reduced formal press briefings from about one hundred in 2017 to about half that in 2018 and to two in 2019; they also revoked the press passes of two White House reporters, which were restored by the courts.[650] Trump\\'s 2020 presidential campaign sued The New York Times, The Washington Post, and CNN for defamation in opinion pieces about his stance on Russian election interference. All the suits were dismissed.[651][652] By 2024, Trump repeatedly voiced support for outlawing political dissent and criticism,[653] and said that reporters should be prosecuted for not divulging confidential sources and media companies should possibly lose their broadcast licenses for unfavorable coverage of him.[654] Following his reelection, Trump launched lawsuits and created blacklists against certain media outlets, took over the process run by the White House Correspondents\\' Association to choose what outlets could gain access to him,[655] and the Federal Communications Commission launched investigations into media outlets accused of bias against him.[656]\\n\\nPersonal life\\nFamily\\nFurther information: Family of Donald Trump\\nIn 1977, Trump married Czech model Ivana Zelníčková.[657] They had three children: Donald Jr. (b. 1977), Ivanka (b. 1981), and Eric (b. 1984). The couple divorced in 1990, following his affair with model and actress Marla Maples.[658] He and Maples married in 1993 and divorced in 1999. They have one daughter, Tiffany (b. 1993), whom Maples raised in California.[659] In 2005, he married Slovenian model Melania Knauss.[660] They have one son, Barron (b. 2006).[661]\\n\\nHealth\\nMain article: Age and health concerns about Donald Trump\\nTrump says he has never drunk alcohol, smoked cigarettes, or used drugs.[662][663] He sleeps about four or five hours a night.[664][665] He has called golfing his \"primary form of exercise\", but usually does not walk the course.[666] He considers exercise a waste of energy because he believes the body is \"like a battery, with a finite amount of energy\", which is depleted by exercise.[667][668] In 2015, his campaign released a letter from his longtime personal physician, Harold Bornstein, stating that he would \"be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency\".[669] In 2018, Bornstein said Trump had dictated the contents of the letter and that three of Trump\\'s agents had seized his medical records in a February 2017 raid on Bornstein\\'s office.[669][670]\\n\\nReligion\\nMain article: Donald Trump and religion\\nTrump said in 2016 that he was a Presbyterian and a Protestant.[671][672] In 2020, he said he was a nondenominational Christian.[673]\\n\\nAssessments\\nPublic image\\nMain articles: Public image of Donald Trump and Donald Trump in popular culture\\nSee also: Opinion polling on the first Donald Trump administration and Opinion polling on the second Donald Trump administration\\nA Gallup poll in 134 countries comparing the approval ratings of U.S. leadership between 2016 and 2017 found that Trump led Obama in job approval in 29 countries, most of them non-democracies;[674] approval of U.S. leadership plummeted among its allies.[675] By mid-2020, 16 percent of international respondents to a 13-nation Pew Research poll expressed confidence in Trump, lower than China\\'s Xi Jinping and Russia\\'s Vladimir Putin.[676]\\n\\nDuring his first presidency, research from 2020 found that Trump had a stronger impact on popular assessments towards American political parties and partisan opinions than any president since Harry S. Truman.[677] In 2021, he was identified as the only president never to reach a 50 percent approval rating in the Gallup poll, which dates to 1938, partially due to a record-high partisan gap in his approval ratings: 88 percent among Republicans and 7 percent among Democrats.[678] His early ratings were unusually stable, ranging between 35 and 49 percent.[679] He finished his term with a rating between 29 and 34 percent—the lowest of any president since modern polling began—and a record-low average of 41 percent throughout his presidency.[678][680]\\n\\nIn Gallup\\'s annual poll asking Americans to name the man they admire the most, Trump placed second to Obama in 2017 and 2018, tied with Obama for first in 2019, and placed first in 2020.[681][682] Since Gallup started conducting the poll in 1946, he was the first elected president not to be named most admired in his first year in office.[683]\\n\\nAccording to Gallup, Trump began his second term with an approval rating of 47% and a disapproval rating of 48%. His approval rating was extremely politically polarized, being approved by 91% of Republicans, 46% of independents, and 6% of Democrats.[684]\\n\\nScholarly rankings\\nFurther information: Historical rankings of presidents of the United States\\nIn C-SPAN\\'s 2021 survey of presidential historians,[685] historians ranked Trump as the fourth-worst president. He rated lowest in the leadership characteristics categories for moral authority and administrative skills.[686][687] The Siena College Research Institute\\'s 2022 survey ranked him third-worst. He was ranked near the bottom in all categories except for luck, willingness to take risks, and party leadership, and ranked last in several categories.[688] In 2018 and 2024, members of the American Political Science Association ranked him the worst president.[689][690]\\n\\nSee also\\nAwards and honors received by Donald Trump\\nPseudonyms used by Donald Trump\\nNotes\\n Beginning when Trump was three years old, his father gave each of his children $6,000 every year, the maximum allowed without incurring a gift tax.

If\\nthe bowling speed is 143 km h–1 in Fig. 7.2(a)\\nwhat does it mean? What do you understand\\nfrom the signboard in Fig. 7.2(b)?\\nDif fer ent objects may take dif fer ent\\namounts of time to cover a given distance.\\nSome of them move fast and some move\\nslowly. The rate at which objects move can\\nbe different. Also, different objects can move\\nat the same rate. One of the ways of\\nmeasuring the rate of motion of an object is\\nto find out the distance travelled by the object\\nin unit time. This quantity is referred to as\\nspeed. The SI unit of speed is metr e per\\nsecond. This is r epresented by the symbol\\nm s–1 or m/s. The other units of speed include\\ncentimetre per second (cm s–1) and kilometre\\nper hour (km h–1). To specify the speed of an\\nobject, we r equire only its magnitude. The\\nspeed of an object need not be constant. In\\nmost cases, objects will be in non-uniform\\nmotion. Ther efore, we describe the rate of\\nmotion of such objects in ter ms of their\\naverage speed. The average speed of an object\\nis obtained by dividing the total distance\\ntravelled by the total time taken. That is,\\naverage speed =\\n Total distance travelled\\nTotal time taken\\nIf an object travels a distance s in time t then\\nits speed v is,\\nv = s\\nt (7.1)\\nLet us understand this by an example. A\\ncar travels a distance of 100 km in 2 h. Its\\naverage speed is 50 km h –1. The car might\\nnot have travelled at 50 km h –1 all the time.\\nSometimes it might have travelled faster and\\nsometimes slower than this.\\nExample 7.1 An object travels 16 m in 4 s\\nand then another 16 m in 2 s. What is\\nthe average speed of the object?\\nSolution:\\nTotal distance travelled by the object =\\n16 m + 16 m = 32 m\\nTotal time taken = 4 s + 2 s = 6 s\\nAverage speed = \\nTotal distance travelled\\nTotal time taken\\n= \\n32 m\\n6 s = 5.33 m s–1\\nTherefore, the average speed of the object\\nis 5.33 m s–1.\\n7.2.1 SPEED WITH DIRECTION\\nThe rate of motion of an object can be mor e\\ncomprehensive if we specify its dir ection of\\nmotion along with its speed. The quantity that\\nspecifies both these aspects is called velocity.\\nVelocity is the speed of an object moving in a\\ndefinite dir ection. The velocity of an object\\ncan be uniform or variable. It can be changed\\nby changing the object’s speed, dir ection of\\nmotion or both. When an object is moving\\nalong a straight line at a variable speed, we\\ncan expr ess the magnitude of its rate of\\nmotion in ter ms of average velocity. It is\\ncalculated in the same way as we calculate\\naverage speed.\\nIn case the velocity of the object is\\nchanging at a unifor m rate, then average\\nvelocity is given by the arithmetic mean of\\ninitial velocity and final velocity for a given\\nperiod of time. That is,\\naverage velocity = \\ninitial velocity + final velocity\\n2\\nMathematically, v av  = \\nu + v\\n2\\n(7.2)\\nwhere vav is the average velocity, u is the initial\\nvelocity and v is the final velocity of the object.\\nSpeed and velocity have the same units,\\nthat is, m s–1 or m/s.\\nActivity ______________ 7.6\\n• Measure the time it takes you to walk\\nfrom your house to your bus stop or\\nthe school.

This shows that the\\ndistance travelled by the object is directly\\nproportional to time taken. Thus, for uniform\\nspeed, a graph of distance travelled against\\ntime is a straight line, as shown in Fig. 7.3.\\nThe portion OB of the graph shows that the\\ndistance is increasing at a uniform rate. Note\\nthat, you can also use the term uniform\\nvelocity in place of uniform speed if you take\\nthe magnitude of displacement equal to the\\ndistance travelled by the object along the\\ny-axis.\\nWe can use the distance-time graph to\\ndetermine the speed of an object. To do so,\\nconsider a small part AB of the distance-time\\ngraph shown in Fig 7.3. Draw a line parallel\\nto the x-axis from point A and another line\\nparallel to the y-axis from point B. These two\\nlines meet each other at point C to form a\\ntriangle ABC. Now, on the graph, AC denotes\\nthe time interval (t2 – t1) while BC corresponds\\nto the distance (s2 – s1). We can see from the\\ngraph that as the object moves from the point\\nA to B, it covers a distance (s2 – s1) in time\\n(t2 – t1). The speed, v of the object, therefore\\ncan be represented as\\n  = \\n2 1\\n2 1\\n–\\n–\\ns s\\nt t (7.4)\\nWe can also plot the distance-time graph\\nfor accelerated motion.

The velocity\\nof 40 km h–1 is represented by the height AC\\nor BD and the time (t2 – t1) is represented by\\nthe length AB.\\nSo, the distance s moved by the car in\\ntime (t2 – t1) can be expressed as\\ns = AC × CD\\n= [(40 km h–1) × (t2 – t1) h]\\n= 40 (t2– t1) km\\n= area of the rectangle ABDC (shaded\\nin Fig. 7.5).\\nWe can also study about unifor mly\\naccelerated motion by plotting its velocity–\\ntime graph.

How many\\ntimes will the athlete have to change his\\ndirection of motion, while he completes one\\nround? It is clear that to move in a rectangular\\ntrack once, he has to change his direction of\\nmotion four times.\\nNow, suppose instead of a rectangular\\ntrack, the athlete is running along a\\nhexagonal shaped path ABCDEF , as shown\\nin Fig. 7.8(b). In this situation, the athlete will\\nhave to change his direction six times while\\nhe  completes one round. What if the track\\nwas not a hexagon but a regular octagon,\\nwith eight equal sides as shown by\\nABCDEFGH in Fig. 7.8(c)?  It is observed that\\nas the number of sides of the track increases\\nthe athelete has to take turns more and more\\noften. What would happen to the shape of the\\ntrack as we go on increasing the number of\\nsides indefinitely? If you do this you will\\nnotice that the shape of the track approaches\\nthe shape of a circle and the length of each of\\nthe sides will decrease to a point. If the athlete\\nmoves with a velocity of constant magnitude\\nalong the circular path, the only change in\\nhis velocity is due to the change in the\\ndirection of motion. The motion of the athlete\\nmoving along a circular path is, therefore, an\\nexample of an accelerated motion.\\nWe know  that the circumference of a circle\\nof radius r is given by \\nπ2 r .

It is the seventh-largest country by area; the most populous country from June 2023 onwards;[22][23] and since its independence in 1947, the world\\'s most populous democracy.[24][25][26] Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west;[k] China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is near Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand, Myanmar, and Indonesia.\\nModern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago.[28][29][30] Their long occupation, predominantly in isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse, second only to Africa in human genetic diversity.[31] Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE.[32] By 1200\\xa0BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit, an Indo-European language, had diffused into India from the northwest.[33][34] Its hymns recorded the dawning of Hinduism in India.[35] India\\'s pre-existing Dravidian languages were supplanted in the northern regions.[36] By 400\\xa0BCE, caste had emerged within Hinduism,[37] and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity.[38] Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires.[39] Widespread creativity suffused this era,[40] but the status of women declined,[41] and untouchability became an organized belief.[l][42] In South India, the Middle kingdoms exported Dravidian language scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms of Southeast Asia.[43]\\nIn the early mediaeval era, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism became established on India\\'s southern and western coasts.[44] Muslim armies from Central Asia intermittently overran India\\'s northern plains.[45] The resulting Delhi Sultanate drew northern India into the cosmopolitan networks of mediaeval Islam.[46] In south India, the Vijayanagara Empire created a long-lasting composite Hindu culture.[47] In the Punjab, Sikhism emerged, rejecting institutionalised religion.[48] The Mughal Empire, in 1526, ushered in two centuries of relative peace,[49] leaving a legacy of luminous architecture.[m][50] Gradually expanding rule of the British East India Company  turned India into a colonial economy but consolidated its sovereignty.[51] British Crown rule began in 1858. The rights promised to Indians were granted slowly,[52][53] but technological changes were introduced, and modern ideas of education and public life took root.[54] A pioneering and influential nationalist movement, noted for nonviolent resistance, became the major factor in ending British rule.[55][56] In 1947, the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two independent dominions,[57][58][59][60] a Hindu-majority dominion of India and a Muslim-majority dominion of Pakistan. A large-scale loss of life and an unprecedented migration accompanied the partition.[61]\\nIndia has been a federal republic since 1950, governed through a democratic parliamentary system. It is a pluralistic, multilingual and multi-ethnic society. India\\'s population grew from 361 million in 1951 to over 1.4\\xa0billion in 2023.[62]\\nDuring this time, its nominal per capita income increased from US$64 annually to US$2,601, and its literacy rate from 16.6% to 74%. A comparatively destitute country in 1951,[63] India has become a fast-growing major economy and hub for information technology services; it has an expanding middle class.[64] Indian movies and music increasingly influence global culture.[65] India has reduced its poverty rate, though at the cost of increasing economic inequality.[66] It is a nuclear-weapon state that ranks high in military expenditure. It has disputes over Kashmir with its neighbours, Pakistan and China, unresolved since the mid-20th century.[67] Among the socio-economic challenges India faces are gender inequality, child malnutrition,[68] and rising levels of air pollution.[69] India\\'s land is megadiverse with four biodiversity hotspots.[70] India\\'s wildlife, which has traditionally been viewed with tolerance in its culture,[71] is supported in protected habitats.\\n\\n\\nEtymology\\nMain article: Names for India\\nAccording to the Oxford English Dictionary (2009), the name \"India\" is derived from the Classical Latin India, a reference to South Asia and an uncertain region to its east. In turn \"India\" derived successively from Hellenistic Greek India ( Ἰνδία), ancient Greek Indos ( Ἰνδός), Old Persian Hindush (an eastern province of the Achaemenid Empire), and ultimately its cognate, the Sanskrit Sindhu, or \"river\", specifically the Indus River and, by implication, its well-settled southern basin.[72][73] The ancient Greeks referred to the Indians as Indoi, \"The people of the Indus\".[74]\\nThe term Bharat (Bhārat; pronounced [ˈbʱaːɾət] ⓘ), mentioned in both Indian epic poetry and the Constitution of India,[75][76] is used in its variations by many Indian languages. A modern rendering of the historical name Bharatavarsha, which applied originally to North India,[77][78] Bharat gained increased currency from the mid-19th century as a native name for India.[75][79]\\nHindustan ([ɦɪndʊˈstaːn] ⓘ) is a Middle Persian name for India that became popular by the 13th century,[80] and was used widely since the era of the Mughal Empire. The meaning of Hindustan has varied, referring to a region encompassing the northern Indian subcontinent (present-day northern India and Pakistan) or to India in its near entirety.[75][79][81]\\n\\nHistory\\nMain articles: History of India and History of the Republic of India\\nAncient India\\nManuscript illustration, c.\\u20091650, of the Sanskrit epic Ramayana, composed in story-telling fashion c.\\u2009400\\xa0BCE\\xa0– c.\\u2009300\\xa0CE[82]\\nBy 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans, or Homo sapiens, had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa.[28][29][30] The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years ago.[28] After 6500\\xa0BCE, evidence for domestication of food crops and animals, construction of permanent structures, and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in Balochistan, Pakistan.[83] These gradually developed into the Indus Valley Civilisation,[84][83] the first urban culture in South Asia,[85] which flourished during 2500–1900\\xa0BCE in Pakistan and western India.[86] Centred around cities such as Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, Dholavira, and Kalibangan, and relying on varied forms of subsistence, the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and wide-ranging trade.[85]\\nDuring the period 2000–500\\xa0BCE, many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the Chalcolithic cultures to the Iron Age ones.[87] The Vedas, the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism,[88] were composed during this period,[89] and historians have analysed these to posit a Vedic culture in the Punjab region and the upper Gangetic Plain.[87] Most historians also consider this period to have encompassed several waves of Indo-Aryan migration into the subcontinent from the north-west.[88] The caste system, which created a hierarchy of priests, warriors, and free peasants, but which excluded indigenous peoples by labelling their occupations impure, arose during this period.[90] On the Deccan Plateau, archaeological evidence from this period suggests the existence of a chiefdom stage of political organisation.[87] In South India, a progression to sedentary life is indicated by the large number of megalithic monuments dating from this period,[91] as well as by nearby traces of agriculture, irrigation tanks, and craft traditions.[91]\\n\\nCave 26 of the rock-cut Ajanta Caves\\nIn the late Vedic period, around the 6th century BCE, the small states and chiefdoms of the Ganges Plain and the north-western regions had consolidated into 16 major oligarchies and monarchies that were known as the mahajanapadas.[92][93] The emerging urbanisation gave rise to non-Vedic religious movements, two of which became independent religions. Jainism came into prominence during the life of its exemplar, Mahavira.[94] Buddhism, based on the teachings of Gautama Buddha, attracted followers from all social classes excepting the middle class; chronicling the life of the Buddha was central to the beginnings of recorded history in India.[95][96][97] In an age of increasing urban wealth, both religions held up renunciation as an ideal,[98] and both established long-lasting monastic traditions. Politically, by the 3rd century BCE, the kingdom of Magadha had annexed or reduced other states to emerge as the Maurya Empire.[99] The empire was once thought to have controlled most of the subcontinent except the far south, but its core regions are now thought to have been separated by large autonomous areas.[100][101] The Mauryan kings are known as much for their empire-building and determined management of public life as for Ashoka\\'s renunciation of militarism and far-flung advocacy of the Buddhist dhamma.[102][103]\\nThe Sangam literature of the Tamil language reveals that, between 200\\xa0BCE and 200\\xa0CE, the southern peninsula was ruled by the Cheras, the Cholas, and the Pandyas, dynasties that traded extensively with the Roman Empire and with West and Southeast Asia.[104][105] In North India, Hinduism asserted patriarchal control within the family, leading to increased subordination of women.[106][99] By the 4th and 5th centuries, the Gupta Empire had created a complex system of administration and taxation in the greater Ganges Plain; this system became a model for later Indian kingdoms.[107][108] Under the Guptas, a renewed Hinduism based on devotion, rather than the management of ritual, began to assert itself.[109] This renewal was reflected in a flowering of sculpture and architecture, which found patrons among an urban elite.[108] Classical Sanskrit literature flowered as well, and Indian science, astronomy, medicine, and mathematics made significant advances.[108]\\n\\nMedieval India\\nMain article: Medieval India\\nBrihadeshwara temple, Thanjavur, completed in 1010\\xa0CEThe Qutub Minar, 73\\xa0m (240\\xa0ft) tall, completed by the Sultan of Delhi, Iltutmish\\nThe Indian early medieval age, from 600 to 1200\\xa0CE, is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity.[110] When Harsha of Kannauj, who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from 606 to 647\\xa0CE, attempted to expand southwards, he was defeated by the Chalukya ruler of the Deccan.[111] When his successor attempted to expand eastwards, he was defeated by the Pala king of Bengal.[111] When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards, they were defeated by the Pallavas from farther south, who in turn were opposed by the Pandyas and the Cholas from still farther south.[111] No ruler of this period was able to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond their core region.[110] During this time, pastoral peoples, whose land had been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy, were accommodated within caste society, as were new non-traditional ruling classes.[112] The caste system consequently began to show regional differences.[112]\\nIn the 6th and 7th centuries, the first devotional hymns were created in the Tamil language.[113] They were imitated all over India and led to both the resurgence of Hinduism and the development of all modern languages of the subcontinent.[113] Indian royalty, big and small, and the temples they patronised drew citizens in great numbers to the capital cities, which became economic hubs as well.[114] Temple towns of various sizes began to appear everywhere as India underwent another urbanisation.[114] By the 8th and 9th centuries, the effects were felt in Southeast Asia, as South Indian culture and political systems were exported to lands that became part of modern-day Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Brunei, Cambodia, Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia.[115] Indian merchants, scholars, and sometimes armies were involved in this transmission; Southeast Asians took the initiative as well, with many sojourning in Indian seminaries and translating Buddhist and Hindu texts into their languages.[115]\\nAfter the 10th century, Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans, using swift-horse cavalry and raising vast armies united by ethnicity and religion, repeatedly overran South Asia\\'s north-western plains, leading eventually to the establishment of the Islamic Delhi Sultanate in 1206.[116] The sultanate was to control much of North India and to make many forays into South India. Although at first disruptive for the Indian elites, the sultanate largely left its vast non-Muslim subject population to its own laws and customs.[117][118] By repeatedly repulsing Mongol raiders in the 13th century, the sultanate saved India from the devastation visited on West and Central Asia, setting the scene for centuries of migration of fleeing soldiers, learned men, mystics, traders, artists, and artisans from that region into the subcontinent, thereby creating a syncretic Indo-Islamic culture in the north.[119][120] The sultanate\\'s raiding and weakening of the regional kingdoms of South India paved the way for the indigenous Vijayanagara Empire.[121] Embracing a strong Shaivite tradition and building upon the military technology of the sultanate, the empire came to control much of peninsular India,[122] and was to influence South Indian society for long afterwards.[121]\\n\\nEarly modern India\\nIn the early 16th century, northern India, then under mainly Muslim rulers,[123] fell again to the superior mobility and firepower of a new generation of Central Asian warriors.[124] The resulting Mughal Empire did not stamp out the local societies it came to rule. Instead, it balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices[125][126] and diverse and inclusive ruling elites,[127] leading to more systematic, centralised, and uniform rule.[128] Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic identity, especially under Akbar, the Mughals united their far-flung realms through loyalty, expressed through a Persianised culture, to an emperor who had near-divine status.[127] The Mughal state\\'s economic policies, deriving most revenues from agriculture[129] and mandating that taxes be paid in the well-regulated silver currency,[130] caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets.[128] The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a factor in India\\'s economic expansion,[128] resulting in greater patronage of painting, literary forms, textiles, and architecture.[131] Newly coherent social groups in northern and western India, such as the Marathas, the Rajputs, and the Sikhs, gained military and governing ambitions during Mughal rule, which, through collaboration or adversity, gave them both recognition and military experience.[132] Expanding commerce during Mughal rule gave rise to new Indian commercial and political elites along the coasts of southern and eastern India.[132] As the empire disintegrated, many among these elites were able to seek and control their own affairs.[133]\\n\\nA distant view of the Taj Mahal from the Agra FortA two mohur Company gold coin, issued in 1835, the obverse inscribed \"William IIII, King\"\\nBy the early 18th century, with the lines between commercial and political dominance being increasingly blurred, a number of European trading companies, including the English East India Company, had established coastal outposts.[134][135] The East India Company\\'s control of the seas, greater resources, and more advanced military training and technology led it to increasingly assert its military strength and caused it to become attractive to a portion of the Indian elite; these factors were crucial in allowing the company to gain control over the Bengal region by 1765 and sideline the other European companies.[136][134][137][138] Its further access to the riches of Bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to annex or subdue most of India by the 1820s.[139] India was then no longer exporting manufactured goods as it long had, but was instead supplying the British Empire with raw materials. Many historians consider this to be the onset of India\\'s colonial period.[134] By this time, with its economic power severely curtailed by the British parliament and having effectively been made an arm of British administration, the East India Company began more consciously to enter non-economic arenas, including education, social reform, and culture.[140]\\n\\nModern India\\nMain article: History of India (1947–present)\\nHistorians consider India\\'s modern age to have begun sometime between 1848 and 1885. The appointment in 1848 of Lord Dalhousie as Governor General of the East India Company set the stage for changes essential to a modern state. These included the consolidation and demarcation of sovereignty, the surveillance of the population, and the education of citizens. Technological changes—among them, railways, canals, and the telegraph—were introduced not long after their introduction in Europe.[141][142][143][144] However, disaffection with the company also grew during this time and set off the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Fed by diverse resentments and perceptions, including invasive British-style social reforms, harsh land taxes, and summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes, the rebellion rocked many regions of northern and central India and shook the foundations of Company rule.[145][146] Although the rebellion was suppressed by 1858, it led to the dissolution of the East India Company and the direct administration of India by the British government. Proclaiming a unitary state and a gradual but limited British-style parliamentary system, the new rulers also protected princes and landed gentry as a feudal safeguard against future unrest.[147][148] In the decades following, public life gradually emerged all over India, leading eventually to the founding of the Indian National Congress in 1885.[149][150][151][152]\\nThe rush of technology and the commercialisation of agriculture in the second half of the 19th century was marked by economic setbacks, and many small farmers became dependent on the whims of far-away markets.[153] There was an increase in the number of large-scale famines,[154] and, despite the risks of infrastructure development borne by Indian taxpayers, little industrial employment was generated for Indians.[155] There were also salutary effects: commercial cropping, especially in the newly canalled Punjab, led to increased food production for internal consumption.[156] The railway network provided critical famine relief,[157] notably reduced the cost of moving goods,[157] and helped nascent Indian-owned industry.[156]\\n\\n1909 map of the British Indian EmpireJawaharlal Nehru sharing a light moment with Mahatma Gandhi, Mumbai, 6 July 1946\\nAfter World War I, in which approximately one million Indians served,[158] a new period began. It was marked by British reforms but also repressive legislation, by more strident Indian calls for self-rule, and by the beginnings of a nonviolent movement of non-co-operation, of which Mahatma Gandhi would become the leader and enduring symbol.[159] During the 1930s, slow legislative reform was enacted by the British; the Indian National Congress won victories in the resulting elections.[160] The next decade was beset with crises: Indian participation in World War\\xa0II, the Congress\\'s final push for non-co-operation, and an upsurge of Muslim nationalism. All were capped by the advent of independence in 1947, but tempered by the partition of India into two states: India and Pakistan.[161]\\nVital to India\\'s self-image as an independent nation was its constitution, completed in 1950, which put in place a secular and democratic republic.[162]  Economic liberalisation, which began in the 1980s and the collaboration with Soviet Union for technical know-how,[163] has created a large urban middle class, transformed India into one of the world\\'s fastest-growing economies,[164] and increased its geopolitical clout. Yet, India is also shaped by seemingly unyielding poverty, both rural and urban;[165] by religious and caste-related violence;[166] by Maoist-inspired Naxalite insurgencies;[167] and by separatism in Jammu and Kashmir and in Northeast India.[168] It has unresolved territorial disputes with China[169] and with Pakistan.[169] India\\'s sustained democratic freedoms are unique among the world\\'s newer nations; however, in spite of its recent economic successes, freedom from want for its disadvantaged population remains a goal yet to be achieved.[170]\\n\\nGeography\\nMain article: Geography of India\\nIndia accounts for the bulk of the Indian subcontinent, lying atop the Indian tectonic plate, a part of the Indo-Australian Plate.[171] India\\'s defining geological processes began 75 million years ago when the Indian Plate, then part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana, began a north-eastward drift caused by seafloor spreading to its south-west, and later, south and south-east.[171] Simultaneously, the vast Tethyan oceanic crust, to its northeast, began to subduct under the Eurasian Plate.[171] These dual processes, driven by convection in the Earth\\'s mantle, both created the Indian Ocean and caused the Indian continental crust eventually to under-thrust Eurasia and to uplift the Himalayas.[171] Immediately south of the emerging Himalayas, plate movement created a vast crescent-shaped trough that rapidly filled with river-borne sediment[172] and now constitutes the Indo-Gangetic Plain.[173] The original Indian plate makes its first appearance above the sediment in the ancient Aravalli range, which extends from the Delhi Ridge in a southwesterly direction. To the west lies the Thar Desert, the eastern spread of which is checked by the Aravallis.[174][175][176]\\n\\nThe Tungabhadra, with rocky outcrops, flows into the peninsular Krishna River.[177]Fishing boats lashed together in a tidal creek in Anjarle village, Maharashtra\\nThe remaining Indian Plate survives as peninsular India, the oldest and geologically most stable part of India. It extends as far north as the Satpura and Vindhya ranges in central India. These parallel chains run from the Arabian Sea coast in Gujarat in the west to the coal-rich Chota Nagpur Plateau in Jharkhand in the east.[178] To the south, the remaining peninsular landmass, the Deccan Plateau, is flanked on the west and east by coastal ranges known as the Western and Eastern Ghats;[179] the plateau contains the country\\'s oldest rock formations, some over one billion years old. Constituted in such fashion, India lies to the north of the equator between 6° 44′ and 35° 30′ north latitude[n] and 68° 7′ and 97° 25′ east longitude.[180]\\nIndia\\'s coastline measures 7,517 kilometres (4,700\\xa0mi) in length; of this distance, 5,423 kilometres (3,400\\xa0mi) belong to peninsular India and 2,094 kilometres (1,300\\xa0mi) to the Andaman, Nicobar, and Lakshadweep island chains.[181] According to the Indian naval hydrographic charts, the mainland coastline consists of the following: 43% sandy beaches; 11% rocky shores, including cliffs; and 46% mudflats or marshy shores.[181]\\nMajor Himalayan-origin rivers that substantially flow through India include the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, both of which drain into the Bay of Bengal.[182] Important tributaries of the Ganges include the Yamuna and the Kosi; the latter\\'s extremely low gradient, caused by long-term silt deposition, leads to severe floods and course changes.[183][184] Major peninsular rivers, whose steeper gradients prevent their waters from flooding, include the Godavari, the Mahanadi, the Kaveri, and the Krishna, which also drain into the Bay of Bengal;[185] and the Narmada and the Tapti, which drain into the Arabian Sea.[186] Coastal features include the marshy Rann of Kutch of western India and the alluvial Sundarbans delta of eastern India; the latter is shared with Bangladesh.[187] India has two archipelagos: the Lakshadweep, coral atolls off India\\'s south-western coast; and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a volcanic chain in the Andaman Sea.[188]\\nIndian climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter monsoons.[189] The Himalayas prevent cold Central Asian katabatic winds from blowing in, keeping the bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes.[190][191] The Thar Desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moisture-laden south-west summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India\\'s rainfall.[189] Four major climatic groupings predominate in India: tropical wet, tropical dry, subtropical humid, and montane.[192]\\nTemperatures in India have risen by 0.7\\xa0°C (1.3\\xa0°F) between 1901 and 2018.[193] Climate change in India is often thought to be the cause. The retreat of Himalayan glaciers has adversely affected the flow rate of the major Himalayan rivers, including the Ganges and the Brahmaputra.[194] According to some current projections, the number and severity of droughts in India will have markedly increased by the end of the present century.[195]\\n\\nBiodiversity\\nMain articles: Forestry in India and Wildlife of India\\nIndia is a megadiverse country, a term employed for 17 countries that display high biological diversity and contain many species exclusively indigenous, or endemic, to them.[196] India is the habitat for 8.6% of all mammals, 13.7% of bird species, 7.9% of reptile species, 6% of amphibian species, 12.2% of fish species, and 6.0% of all flowering plant species.[197][198] Fully a third of Indian plant species are endemic.[199] India also contains four of the world\\'s 34 biodiversity hotspots,[70] or regions that display significant habitat loss in the presence of high endemism.[o][200]\\nIndia\\'s most dense forests, such as the tropical moist forest of the Andaman Islands, the Western Ghats, and Northeast India, occupy approximately 3% of its land area.[201][202] Moderately dense forest, whose canopy density is between 40% and 70%, occupies 9.39% of India\\'s land area.[201][202] It predominates in the temperate coniferous forest of the Himalayas, the moist deciduous sal forest of eastern India, and the dry deciduous teak forest of central and southern India.[203] India has two natural zones of thorn forest, one in the Deccan Plateau, immediately east of the Western Ghats, and the other in the western part of the Indo-Gangetic plain, now turned into rich agricultural land by irrigation, its features no longer visible.[204]\\nAmong the Indian subcontinent\\'s notable indigenous trees are the astringent Azadirachta indica, or neem, which is widely used in rural Indian herbal medicine,[205] and the luxuriant Ficus religiosa, or peepul,[206] which is displayed on the ancient seals of Mohenjo-daro,[207] and under which the Buddha is recorded in the Pali canon to have sought enlightenment.[208]\\nMany Indian species have descended from those of Gondwana, the southern supercontinent from which India separated more than 100 million years ago.[209] India\\'s subsequent collision with Eurasia set off a mass exchange of species. However, volcanism and climatic changes later caused the extinction of many endemic Indian forms.[210] Still later, mammals entered India from Asia through two zoogeographic passes flanking the Himalayas.[211] This had the effect of lowering endemism among India\\'s mammals, which stands at 12.6%, contrasting with 45.8% among reptiles and 55.8% among amphibians.[198] Among endemics are the vulnerable[212] hooded leaf monkey[213] and the threatened[214] Beddome\\'s toad[214][215] of the Western Ghats.\\nIndia contains 172 IUCN-designated threatened animal species, or 2.9% of endangered forms.[216] These include the endangered Bengal tiger and the Ganges river dolphin. Critically endangered species include the gharial, a crocodilian; the great Indian bustard; and the Indian white-rumped vulture, which has become nearly extinct by having ingested the carrion of diclofenac-treated cattle.[217] Before they were extensively used for agriculture and cleared for human settlement, the thorn forests of Punjab were mingled at intervals with open grasslands that were grazed by large herds of blackbuck preyed on by the Asiatic cheetah; the blackbuck, no longer extant in Punjab, is now severely endangered in India, and the cheetah is extinct.[218] The pervasive and ecologically devastating human encroachment of recent decades has critically endangered Indian wildlife. In response, the system of national parks and protected areas, first established in 1935, was expanded substantially. In 1972, India enacted the Wildlife Protection Act[219] and Project Tiger to safeguard crucial wilderness; the Forest Conservation Act was enacted in 1980 and amendments added in 1988.[220] India hosts more than five hundred wildlife sanctuaries and eighteen\\xa0biosphere reserves,[221] four of which are part of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves; seventy-five wetlands are registered under the Ramsar Convention.[222]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIndia has the majority of the world\\'s wild tigers, approximately 3,170 in 2022.[223]\\n\\n\\n\\nA chital (Axis axis) stag in the Nagarhole National Park in a region covered by a moderately dense[p] forest.\\n\\n\\n\\nThree of the last Asiatic cheetahs in India were shot dead in 1948 in Surguja district, Madhya Pradesh, Central India by Maharajah Ramanuj Pratap Singh Deo.

V.[224]\\nA parliamentary republic with a multi-party system,[225] India has six\\xa0recognised national parties, including the Indian National Congress (INC) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and more than 50\\xa0regional parties.[226] The Congress is considered center in Indian political culture,[227] and the BJP right-wing.[228][229][230] For most of the period between 1950—when India first became a republic—and the late 1980s, the Congress held a majority in the Parliament. Since then, however, it has increasingly shared the political stage with the BJP,[231] as well as with powerful regional parties which have often forced the creation of multi-party coalition governments at the center.[232]\\nIn the Republic of India\\'s first three general elections, in 1951, 1957, and 1962, the Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru-led Congress won easy victories. On Nehru\\'s death in 1964, Lal Bahadur Shastri briefly became prime minister; he was succeeded, after his own unexpected death in 1966, by Nehru\\'s daughter Indira Gandhi, who went on to lead the Congress to election victories in 1967 and 1971. Following public discontent with the state of emergency she declared in 1975, the Congress was voted out of power in 1977; the then-new Janata Party, which had opposed the emergency, was voted in. Its government lasted just over two years. There were two prime ministers during this period; Morarji Desai and Charan Singh. Voted back into power in 1980, the Congress saw a change in leadership in 1984, when Indira Gandhi was assassinated; she was succeeded by her son Rajiv Gandhi, who won an easy victory in the general elections later that year. The Congress was voted out again in 1989 when a National Front coalition, led by the newly formed Janata Dal in alliance with the Left Front, won the elections; that government too proved relatively short-lived, lasting just under two years. There were two prime ministers during this period; V.P. Singh and Chandra Shekhar.[233] Elections were held again in 1991; no party won an absolute majority. The Congress, as the largest single party, was able to form a minority government led by P. V. Narasimha Rao.[234]\\n\\nUS president Barack Obama addresses the members of the Parliament of India in New Delhi in November 2010.\\nA two-year period of political turmoil followed the general election of 1996. Several short-lived alliances shared power at the centre. The BJP formed a government briefly in 1996; it was followed by two comparatively long-lasting United Front coalitions, which depended on external support. There were two prime ministers during this period; H.D. Deve Gowda and I.K. Gujral. In 1998, the BJP was able to form a successful coalition, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). Led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the NDA became the first non-Congress, coalition government to complete a five-year term.[235] Again in the 2004 Indian general elections, no party won an absolute majority, but the Congress emerged as the largest single party, forming another successful coalition: the United Progressive Alliance (UPA). It had the support of left-leaning parties and MPs who opposed the BJP. The UPA returned to power in the 2009 general election with increased numbers, and it no longer required external support from India\\'s communist parties.[236] That year, Manmohan Singh became the first prime minister since Jawaharlal Nehru in 1957 and 1962 to be re-elected to a consecutive five-year term.[237] In the 2014 general election, the BJP became the first political party since 1984 to win a majority and govern without the support of other parties.[238] In the 2019 general election, the BJP was victorious again with majority. In the 2024 general election, the BJP failed to achieve majority and the BJP-led NDA coalition formed the government. Narendra Modi, a former chief minister of Gujarat, is serving as the prime minister of India in his third term since May 26, 2014.[239]\\n\\nGovernment\\nMain articles: Government of India and Constitution of India\\nRashtrapati Bhavan, the official residence of the President of India, was designed by British architects Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker for the Viceroy of India, and constructed between 1911 and 1931 during the British Raj.[240]\\nIndia is a federation with a parliamentary system governed under the Constitution of India—the country\\'s supreme legal document. It is a constitutional republic. Federalism in India defines the power distribution between the union and the states. The Constitution of India, which came into effect on 26 January 1950,[241] originally stated India to be a \"democratic republic;\" this characterisation was amended in 1971 to a \"socialist, secular, democratic republic\".[242] India\\'s form of government, traditionally described as \"quasi-federal\" with a strong centre and weak states,[243] has grown increasingly federal since the late 1990s as a result of political, economic, and social changes.[244][245]\\nThe Government of India comprises three branches: the Executive, Legislature, and Judiciary.[246] The President of India is the ceremonial head of state,[247] who is elected indirectly for a five-year term by an electoral college comprising members of national and state legislatures.[248][249] The Prime Minister of India is the head of government and exercises most executive power.[250] Appointed by the president,[251] the prime minister is by convention supported by the party or political alliance having a majority of seats in the lower house of parliament.[250] The executive of the Indian government consists of the president, the vice-president, and the Union Council of Ministers—with the cabinet being its executive committee—headed by the prime minister. Any minister holding a portfolio must be a member of one of the houses of parliament.[247] In the Indian parliamentary system, the executive is subordinate to the legislature; the prime minister and their council are directly responsible to the lower house of the parliament. Civil servants act as permanent executives and all decisions of the executive are implemented by them.[252]\\nThe legislature of India is the bicameral parliament. Operating under a Westminster-style parliamentary system, it comprises an upper house called the Rajya Sabha (Council of States) and a lower house called the Lok Sabha (House of the People).[253] The Rajya Sabha is a permanent body of 245\\xa0members who serve staggered six-year terms with elections every 2 years.[254] Most are elected indirectly by the state and union territorial legislatures in numbers proportional to their state\\'s share of the national population.[251] The Lok Sabha\\'s 543\\xa0members are elected directly by popular vote among citizens aged at least 18;[255] they represent single-member constituencies for five-year\\xa0terms.[256] The Indian constitution historically allowed for the nomination of Anglo-Indians to two seats in the Lok Sabha; this provision was removed in 2019.[255][257] A number of seats from each state are reserved for candidates from Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in proportion to their population within that state.[255]\\nIndia has a three-tier\\xa0unitary independent judiciary[258] comprising the supreme court, headed by the Chief Justice of India, 25\\xa0high courts, and a large number of trial courts.[258] The supreme court has original jurisdiction over cases involving fundamental rights and over disputes between states and the centre and has appellate jurisdiction over the high courts.[259] It has the power to both strike down union or state laws which contravene the constitution[260] and invalidate any government action it deems unconstitutional.[261]\\n\\nAdministrative divisions\\nMain article: Administrative divisions of India\\nSee also: Political integration of India\\nIndia is a federal union comprising 28 states and 8 union territories.[12] All states, as well as the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, Puducherry and the National Capital Territory of Delhi, have elected legislatures and governments following the Westminster system. The remaining five union territories are directly ruled by the central government through appointed administrators. In 1956, under the States Reorganisation Act, states were reorganised on a linguistic basis.[262] There are over a quarter of a million local government bodies at city, town, block, district and village levels.[263]\\n\\nA clickable map of the 28 states and 8 union territories of India\\nStates\\n\\nAndhra Pradesh\\nArunachal Pradesh\\nAssam\\nBihar\\nChhattisgarh\\nGoa\\nGujarat\\nHaryana\\nHimachal Pradesh\\nJharkhand\\nKarnataka\\nKerala\\nMadhya Pradesh\\nMaharashtra\\nManipur\\nMeghalaya\\nMizoram\\nNagaland\\nOdisha\\nPunjab\\nRajasthan\\nSikkim\\nTamil Nadu\\nTelangana\\nTripura\\nUttar Pradesh\\nUttarakhand\\nWest Bengal\\nUnion territories\\nAndaman and Nicobar IslandsChandigarhDadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and DiuJammu and KashmirLadakhLakshadweepNational Capital Territory of DelhiPuducherry\\nForeign, economic, and strategic relations\\nMain articles: Foreign relations of India and Indian Armed Forces\\nDuring the 1950s and 60s, India played a pivotal role in the Non-Aligned Movement.[264] From left to right: Gamal Abdel Nasser of United Arab Republic (now Egypt), Josip Broz Tito of Yugoslavia and Jawaharlal Nehru in Belgrade, September 1961.\\nIndia became a republic in 1950 and chose to stay in the Commonwealth of Nations.[265][266] Throughout the decade, India strongly supported decolonisation in Africa and Asia and played a leading role in the Non-Aligned Movement.[267] After initially cordial relations with neighbouring China, India went to war with China in 1962 and was widely thought to have been humiliated.[268] This was followed by another military conflict in 1967 in which India successfully repelled Chinese attack.[269] India has had tense relations with neighbouring Pakistan. The two have gone to war four times: in 1947, 1965, 1971, and 1999. Three of these wars were fought over the disputed territory of Kashmir, while the third, the 1971 war, followed from India\\'s support for the independence of Bangladesh.[270] In the late 1980s, the Indian military twice intervened abroad at the invitation of the host country: a peace-keeping operation in Sri Lanka between 1987 and 1990; and an armed intervention to prevent a 1988 coup d\\'état attempt in the Maldives. After the 1965 war with Pakistan, India began to pursue close military and economic ties with the Soviet Union; by the late 1960s, the Soviet Union was its largest arms supplier.[271]\\nAside from its ongoing special relationship with Russia,[272] India has wide-ranging defence relations with Israel and France. In recent years, it has played key roles in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation and the World Trade Organization. The nation has provided 100,000 military and police personnel to serve in 35 UN peacekeeping operations across four continents. It participates in the East Asia Summit, the G8+5, and other multilateral forums.[273] India has close economic ties with countries in South America,[274] Asia, and Africa; it pursues a \"Look East\" policy that seeks to strengthen partnerships with the ASEAN nations, Japan, and South Korea that revolve around many issues, but especially those involving economic investment and regional security.[275][276]\\n\\nThe Indian Air Force contingent marching at the 221st Bastille Day military parade in Paris, on 14 July 2009.

Despite criticism and military sanctions, India has signed neither the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty nor the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, considering both to be flawed and discriminatory.[279] India maintains a \"no first use\" nuclear policy and is developing a nuclear triad capability as a part of its \"Minimum Credible Deterrence\" doctrine.[280][281] It is developing a ballistic missile defence shield and, a fifth-generation fighter jet.[282][283] Other indigenous military projects involve the design and implementation of Vikrant-class aircraft carriers and Arihant-class nuclear submarines.[284]\\nIndia is estimated to possess up to 172 nuclear warheads, and is considered to be producing both highly enriched uranium (HEU) and weapons-grade plutonium, with its HEU production assumed to be focused on its growing number of nuclear-powered vessels\\' and submarines\\' fuels.[285][286] Kristensen et al. of Nuclear Information Project with the Federation of American Scientists estimate that India is operating eight nuclear-capable systems as of 2024, including aircraft, land-based and sea-based ballistic missile systems, with most of its programs in development thought to be nearing \"completion and to be fielded with the armed forces soon\".[285]\\nSince the end of the Cold War, India has increased its economic, strategic, and military co-operation with the United States and the European Union.[287] In 2008, a civilian nuclear agreement was signed between India and the United States. Although India possessed nuclear weapons at the time and was not a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, it received waivers from the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Nuclear Suppliers Group, ending earlier restrictions on India\\'s nuclear technology and commerce. As a consequence, India became the sixth de facto nuclear weapons state.[288] India subsequently signed co-operation agreements involving civilian nuclear energy with Russia,[289] France,[290] the United Kingdom,[291] and Canada.[292]\\n\\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi of India (left, background) in talks with President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico during a visit to Mexico, 2016\\nThe President of India is the supreme commander of the nation\\'s armed forces; with 1.45\\xa0million active troops, they compose the world\\'s second-largest military.

Widespread state intervention and regulation largely walled the economy off from the outside world. An acute balance of payments crisis in 1991 forced the nation to liberalise its economy;[308] since then, it has moved increasingly towards a free-market system[309][310] by emphasising both foreign trade and direct investment inflows.[311] India has been a member of World Trade Organization since 1 January 1995.[312]\\nThe 522-million-worker Indian labour force is the world\\'s second largest, as of 2017[update].[293] The service sector makes up 55.6% of GDP, the industrial sector 26.3% and the agricultural sector 18.1%. India\\'s foreign exchange remittances of US$100 billion in 2022,[313] highest in the world, were contributed to its economy by 32 million Indians working in foreign countries.[314] Major agricultural products include rice, wheat, oilseed, cotton, jute, tea, sugarcane, and potatoes.[12] Major industries include textiles, telecommunications, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, food processing, steel, transport equipment, cement, mining, petroleum, machinery, and software.[12] In 2006, the share of external trade in India\\'s GDP stood at 24%, up from 6% in 1985.[309] In 2008, India\\'s share of world trade was 1.7%;[315] In 2021, India was the world\\'s ninth-largest importer and the sixteenth-largest exporter.[316] Major exports include petroleum products, textile goods, jewellery, software, engineering goods, chemicals, and manufactured leather goods.[12] Major imports include crude oil, machinery, gems, fertiliser, and chemicals.[12] Between 2001 and 2011, the contribution of petrochemical and engineering goods to total exports grew from 14% to 42%.[317] India was the world\\'s second-largest textile exporter after China in the 2013 calendar year.[318]\\nAveraging an economic growth rate of 7.5% for several years prior to 2007,[309] India has more than doubled its hourly wage rates during the first decade of the 21st century.[319] Some 431 million Indians have left poverty since 1985; India\\'s middle classes are projected to number around 580\\xa0million by 2030.[320] Though ranking 68th in global competitiveness,[321] as of 2010[update], India ranks 17th in financial market sophistication, 24th in the banking sector, 44th in business sophistication, and 39th in innovation, ahead of several advanced economies.[322] With seven of the world\\'s top 15 information technology outsourcing companies based in India, as of 2009[update], the country is viewed as the second-most favourable outsourcing destination after the United States.[323] India is ranked 39th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024.[324] In 2023, India\\'s consumer market was the world\\'s fifth largest.[325]\\nDriven by growth, India\\'s nominal GDP per capita increased steadily from US$308 in 1991, when economic liberalisation began, to US$1,380 in 2010, to an estimated US$2,731 in 2024.

This equates to about 2.5 tons of carbon dioxide per person per year, which is half the world average.[343][344] Increasing access to electricity and clean cooking with liquefied petroleum gas have been priorities for energy in India.[345]\\n\\nSocio-economic challenges\\nHealth workers about to begin another day of immunisation against infectious diseases in 2006.  Eight years later, and three years after India\\'s last case of polio, the World Health Organization declared India to be polio-free.[346]\\nDespite economic growth during recent decades, India continues to face socio-economic challenges. In 2006, India contained the largest number of people living below the World Bank\\'s international poverty line of US$1.25 per day.[347] The proportion decreased from 60% in 1981 to 42% in 2005.[348] Under the World Bank\\'s later revised poverty line, it was 21% in 2011.[q][350] 30.7% of India\\'s children under the age of five are underweight.[351] According to a Food and Agriculture Organization report in 2015, 15% of the population is undernourished.[352][353] The Midday Meal Scheme attempts to lower these rates.[354]\\nA 2018 Walk Free Foundation report estimated that nearly 8\\xa0million people in India were living in different forms of modern slavery, such as bonded labour, child labour, human trafficking, and forced begging.[355] According to the 2011 census, there were 10.1\\xa0million child labourers in the country, a decline of 2.6\\xa0million from 12.6\\xa0million in 2001.[356]\\nSince 1991, economic inequality between India\\'s states has consistently grown: the per-capita net state domestic product of the richest states in 2007 was 3.2 times that of the poorest.[357] Corruption in India is perceived to have decreased. According to the Corruption Perceptions Index, India ranked 78th out of 180 countries in 2018, an improvement from 85th in 2014.[358][359]\\n\\nDemographics, languages, and religion\\nMain articles: Demographics of India, Languages of India, and Religion in India\\nSee also: South Asian ethnic groups\\nIndia by languageThe language families of South Asia\\nWith an estimated 1,428,627,663 residents in 2023, India is the world\\'s most populous country.[13] 1,210,193,422 residents were reported in the 2011 provisional census report.[360] Its population grew by 17.64% from 2001 to 2011,[361] compared to 21.54% growth in the previous decade (1991–2001).[361] The human sex ratio, according to the 2011 census, is 940 females per 1,000 males.[360] The median age was 28.7 in 2020.[293] The first post-colonial census, conducted in 1951, counted 361\\xa0million people.[362] Medical advances made in the last 50 years as well as increased agricultural productivity brought about by the \"Green Revolution\" have caused India\\'s population to grow rapidly.[363]\\nThe life expectancy in India is at 70 years—71.5 years for women, 68.7 years for men.[293] There are around 93 physicians per 100,000 people.[364] Migration from rural to urban areas has been an important dynamic in India\\'s recent history. The number of people living in urban areas grew by 31.2% between 1991 and 2001.[365] Yet, in 2001, over 70% still lived in rural areas.[366][367] The level of urbanisation increased further from 27.81% in the 2001 Census to 31.16% in the 2011 Census. The slowing down of the overall population growth rate was due to the sharp decline in the growth rate in rural areas since 1991.[368] According to the 2011 census, there are 53 million-plus urban agglomerations in India; among them Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad, in decreasing order by population.[369] The literacy rate in 2011 was 74.04%: 65.46% among females and 82.14% among males.[370] The rural-urban literacy gap, which was 21.2 percentage points in 2001, dropped to 16.1 percentage points in 2011. The improvement in the rural literacy rate is twice that of urban areas.[368] Kerala is the most literate state with 93.91% literacy; while Bihar the least with 63.82%.[370]\\n\\nThe interior of San Thome Basilica, Chennai, Tamil Nadu.

India has no national language.[371] Hindi, with the largest number of speakers, is the official language of the government.[372][373] English is used extensively in business and administration and has the status of a \"subsidiary official language\";[6] it is important in education, especially as a medium of higher education. Each state and union territory has one or more official languages, and the constitution recognises in particular 22 \"scheduled languages\".\\nThe 2011 census reported the religion in India with the largest number of followers was Hinduism (79.80% of the population), followed by Islam (14.23%); the remaining were Christianity (2.30%), Sikhism (1.72%), Buddhism (0.70%), Jainism (0.36%) and others[r] (0.9%).[11] India has the third-largest Muslim population—the largest for a non-Muslim majority country.[374][375]\\n\\nCulture\\nMain article: Culture of India\\nA Sikh pilgrim at the Harmandir Sahib, or Golden Temple, in Amritsar, Punjab\\nIndian cultural history spans more than 4,500 years.[376] During the Vedic period (c.\\u20091700\\xa0BCE\\xa0– c.\\u2009500\\xa0BCE), the foundations of Hindu philosophy, mythology, theology and literature were laid, and many beliefs and practices which still exist today, such as dhárma, kárma, yóga, and mokṣa, were established.[74] India is notable for its religious diversity, with Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Islam, Christianity, and Jainism among the nation\\'s major religions.[377] The predominant religion, Hinduism, has been shaped by various historical schools of thought, including those of the Upanishads,[378] the Yoga Sutras, the Bhakti movement,[377] and by Buddhist philosophy.[379]\\n\\nVisual art\\nMain article: Indian art\\nIndia has a very ancient tradition of art, which has exchanged many influences with the rest of Eurasia, especially in the first millennium, when Buddhist art spread with Indian religions to Central, East and Southeast Asia, the last also greatly influenced by Hindu art.[380] Thousands of seals from the Indus Valley Civilization of the third millennium BCE have been found, usually carved with animals, but a few with human figures. The \"Pashupati\" seal, excavated in Mohenjo-daro, Pakistan, in 1928–29, is the best known.[381][382] After this there is a long period with virtually nothing surviving.[382][383] Almost all surviving ancient Indian art thereafter is in various forms of religious sculpture in durable materials, or coins. There was probably originally far more in wood, which is lost. In north India Mauryan art is the first imperial movement.[384][385][386] In the first millennium CE, Buddhist art spread with Indian religions to Central, East and Southeast Asia, the last also greatly influenced by Hindu art.[387] Over the following centuries a distinctly Indian style of sculpting the human figure developed, with less interest in articulating precise anatomy than ancient Greek sculpture but showing smoothly flowing forms expressing prana (\"breath\" or life-force).[388][389] This is often complicated by the need to give figures multiple arms or heads, or represent different genders on the left and right of figures, as with the Ardhanarishvara form of Shiva and Parvati.[390][391]\\nMost of the earliest large sculpture is Buddhist, either excavated from Buddhist stupas such as Sanchi, Sarnath and Amaravati,[392] or is rock cut reliefs at sites such as Ajanta, Karla and Ellora. Hindu and Jain sites appear rather later.[393][394] In spite of this complex mixture of religious traditions, generally, the prevailing artistic style at any time and place has been shared by the major religious groups, and sculptors probably usually served all communities.[395] Gupta art, at its peak c.\\u2009300\\xa0CE\\xa0– c.\\u2009500\\xa0CE, is often regarded as a classical period whose influence lingered for many centuries after; it saw a new dominance of Hindu sculpture, as at the Elephanta Caves.[396][397] Across the north, this became rather stiff and formulaic after c.\\u2009800\\xa0CE, though rich with finely carved detail in the surrounds of statues.[398] But in the South, under the Pallava and Chola dynasties, sculpture in both stone and bronze had a sustained period of great achievement; the large bronzes with Shiva as Nataraja have become an iconic symbol of India.[399][400]\\nAncient painting has only survived at a few sites, of which the crowded scenes of court life in the Ajanta Caves are by far the most important, but it was evidently highly developed, and is mentioned as a courtly accomplishment in Gupta times.[401][402] Painted manuscripts of religious texts survive from Eastern India about the 10th century onwards, most of the earliest being Buddhist and later Jain. No doubt the style of these was used in larger paintings.[403] The Persian-derived Deccan painting, starting just before the Mughal miniature, between them give the first large body of secular painting, with an emphasis on portraits, and the recording of princely pleasures and wars.[404][405] The style spread to Hindu courts, especially among the Rajputs, and developed a variety of styles, with the smaller courts often the most innovative, with figures such as Nihâl Chand and Nainsukh.[406][407] As a market developed among European residents, it was supplied by Company painting by Indian artists with considerable Western influence.[408][409] In the 19th century, cheap Kalighat paintings of gods and everyday life, done on paper, were urban folk art from Calcutta, which later saw the Bengal School of Art, reflecting the art colleges founded by the British, the first movement in modern Indian painting.[410][411]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBhutesvara Yakshis, Buddhist reliefs from Mathura, 2nd century\\xa0CE\\n\\n\\n\\nGupta terracotta relief, Krishna Killing the Horse Demon Keshi, 5th century\\n\\n\\n\\nElephanta Caves, triple-bust (trimurti) of Shiva, 18 feet (5.5\\xa0m) tall, c.\\u2009550\\n\\n\\n\\nChola bronze of Shiva as Nataraja (\"Lord of Dance\"), Tamil Nadu, 10th or 11th century\\n\\n\\n\\nJahangir Receives Prince Khurram at Ajmer on His Return from the Mewar Campaign, Balchand, c.\\u20091635\\n\\n\\n\\nKrishna Fluting to the Milkmaids, Kangra painting, 1775–1785\\n\\n\\nArchitecture\\nMain article: Architecture of India\\nThe Taj Mahal from across the Yamuna river showing two outlying red sandstone buildings, a mosque on the right (west) and a jawab (response) thought to have been built for architectural balance\\nMuch of Indian architecture, including the Taj Mahal, other works of Indo-Islamic Mughal architecture, and South Indian architecture, blends ancient local traditions with imported styles.[412] Vernacular architecture is also regional in its flavours. Vastu shastra, literally \"science of construction\" or \"architecture\" and ascribed to Mamuni Mayan,[413] explores how the laws of nature affect human dwellings;[414] it employs precise geometry and directional alignments to reflect perceived cosmic constructs.[415] As applied in Hindu temple architecture, it is influenced by the Shilpa Shastras, a series of foundational texts whose basic mythological form is the Vastu-Purusha mandala, a square that embodied the \"absolute\".[416] The Taj Mahal, built in Agra between 1631 and 1648 by orders of Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife, has been described in the UNESCO World Heritage List as \"the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world\\'s heritage\".[417] Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture, developed by the British in the late 19th century, drew on Indo-Islamic architecture.[418]\\n\\nLiterature\\nMain article: Indian literature\\nThe earliest literature in India, composed between 1500\\xa0BCE and 1200\\xa0CE, was in the Sanskrit language.[419] Major works of Sanskrit literature include the Rigveda (c.\\u20091500\\xa0BCE\\xa0– c.\\u20091200\\xa0BCE), the epics: Mahābhārata (c.\\u2009400\\xa0BCE\\xa0– c.\\u2009400\\xa0CE) and the Ramayana (c.\\u2009300\\xa0BCE and later); Abhijñānaśākuntalam (The Recognition of Śakuntalā, and other dramas of Kālidāsa (c.\\u20095th century\\xa0CE) and Mahākāvya poetry.[420][421][422] In Tamil literature, the Sangam literature (c.\\u2009600\\xa0BCE\\xa0– c.\\u2009300\\xa0BCE) consisting of 2,381 poems, composed by 473 poets, is the earliest work.[423][424][425][426] From the 14th to the 18th centuries, India\\'s literary traditions went through a period of drastic change because of the emergence of devotional poets like Kabīr, Tulsīdās, and Guru Nānak. This period was characterised by a varied and wide spectrum of thought and expression; as a consequence, medieval Indian literary works differed significantly from classical traditions.[427] In the 19th century, Indian writers took a new interest in social questions and psychological descriptions. In the 20th century, Indian literature was influenced by the works of Rabindranath Tagore,[428] who was a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature.\\n\\nPerforming arts and media\\nMain articles: Music of India, Dance in India, Cinema of India, and Television in India\\nIndia\\'s National Academy of Performance Arts has recognised eight Indian dance styles to be classical.  One such is Kuchipudi shown here.\\nIndian music ranges over various traditions and regional styles. Classical music encompasses two genres and their various folk offshoots: the northern Hindustani and the southern Carnatic schools.[429] Regionalised popular forms include filmi and folk music; the syncretic tradition of the bauls is a well-known form of the latter. Indian dance also features diverse folk and classical forms. Among the better-known folk dances are: bhangra of Punjab, bihu of Assam, Jhumair and chhau of Jharkhand, Odisha and West Bengal, garba and dandiya of Gujarat, ghoomar of Rajasthan, and lavani of Maharashtra. Eight dance forms, many with narrative forms and mythological elements, have been accorded classical dance status by India\\'s National Academy of Music, Dance, and Drama. These are: bharatanatyam of the state of Tamil Nadu, kathak of Uttar Pradesh, kathakali and mohiniyattam of Kerala, kuchipudi of Andhra Pradesh, manipuri of Manipur, odissi of Odisha, and the sattriya of Assam.[430]\\nTheatre in India melds music, dance, and improvised or written dialogue.[431] Often based on Hindu mythology, but also borrowing from medieval romances or social and political events, Indian theatre includes: the bhavai of Gujarat, the jatra of West Bengal, the nautanki and ramlila of North India, tamasha of Maharashtra, burrakatha of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, terukkuttu of Tamil Nadu, and the yakshagana of Karnataka.[432] India has a theatre training institute, the National School of Drama (NSD), in New Delhi.[433]\\nThe Indian film industry produces the world\\'s most-watched cinema.[434] Established regional cinematic traditions exist in the Assamese, Bengali, Bhojpuri, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Punjabi, Gujarati, Marathi, Odia, Tamil, and Telugu languages.[435] The Hindi language film industry (Bollywood) is the largest sector representing 43% of box office revenue, followed by the South Indian Telugu and Tamil film industries which represent 36% combined.[436]\\nTelevision broadcasting began in India in 1959 as a state-run medium of communication and expanded slowly for more than two decades.[437][438] The state monopoly on television broadcast ended in the 1990s. Since then, satellite channels have increasingly shaped the popular culture of Indian society.[439] Today, television is the most penetrative media in India; industry estimates indicate that as of 2012[update] there are over 554 million TV consumers, 462\\xa0million with satellite or cable connections compared to other forms of mass media such as the press (350\\xa0million), radio (156\\xa0million) or internet (37\\xa0million).[440]\\n\\nSociety\\nMuslims offer namaz at a mosque in Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir.\\nTraditional Indian society is sometimes defined by social hierarchy. The Indian caste system embodies much of the social stratification and many of the social restrictions found on the Indian subcontinent. Social classes are defined by thousands of endogamous hereditary groups, often termed as jātis, or \"castes\".[441] India abolished untouchability in 1950 with the adoption of the constitution and has since enacted other anti-discriminatory laws and social welfare initiatives.\\nFamily values are important in the Indian tradition, and multi-generational patrilineal joint families have been the norm in India, though nuclear families are becoming common in urban areas.[442] An overwhelming majority of Indians, with their consent, have their marriages arranged by their parents or other family elders.[443] Marriage is thought to be for life,[443] and the divorce rate is extremely low,[444] with less than one in a thousand marriages ending in divorce.[445] Child marriages are common, especially in rural areas; many women wed before reaching 18, which is their legal marriageable age.[446] Female infanticide in India, and lately female foeticide, have created skewed gender ratios; the number of missing women in the country quadrupled from 15 million to 63\\xa0million in the 50-year period ending in 2014, faster than the population growth during the same period.[447] According to an Indian government study, an additional 21 million girls are unwanted and do not receive adequate care.[448] Despite a government ban on sex-selective foeticide, the practice remains commonplace in India, the result of a preference for boys in a patriarchal society.[449] The payment of dowry, although illegal, remains widespread across class lines.[450] Deaths resulting from dowry, mostly from bride burning, are on the rise, despite stringent anti-dowry laws.[451]\\nMany Indian festivals are religious in origin. The best known include Diwali, Ganesh Chaturthi, Thai Pongal, Holi, Durga Puja, Eid ul-Fitr, Bakr-Id, Christmas, and Vaisakhi.[452][453]\\n\\nEducation\\nMain articles: Education in India, Literacy in India, and History of education in the Indian subcontinent\\nChildren awaiting school lunch in Rayka (also Raika), a village in rural Gujarat.

In 1951 the rates were 18%, 27% and 9%. In 1921 the rates 7%, 12% and 2%. In 1891 they were 5%, 9% and 1%,[454][455] According to Latika Chaudhary, in 1911 there were under three primary schools for every ten villages. Statistically, more caste and religious diversity reduced private spending. Primary schools taught literacy, so local diversity limited its growth.[456]\\nThe education system of India is the world\\'s second-largest.[457] India has over 900 universities, 40,000 colleges[458] and 1.5\\xa0million schools.[459] In India\\'s higher education system, a significant number of seats are reserved under affirmative action policies for the historically disadvantaged. In recent decades India\\'s improved education system is often cited as one of the main contributors to its economic development.[460][461]\\n\\nClothing\\nMain article: Clothing in India\\nWomen in sari at an adult literacy class in Tamil NaduA man in dhoti and wearing a woollen shawl, in Varanasi\\nFrom ancient times until the advent of the modern, the most widely worn traditional dress in India was draped.[462] For women it took the form of a sari, a single piece of cloth many yards long.[462] The sari was traditionally wrapped around the lower body and the shoulder.[462] In its modern form, it is combined with an underskirt, or Indian petticoat, and tucked in the waist band for more secure fastening. It is also commonly worn with an Indian blouse, or choli, which serves as the primary upper-body garment, the sari\\'s end—passing over the shoulder—covering the midriff and obscuring the upper body\\'s contours.[462] For men, a similar but shorter length of cloth, the dhoti, has served as a lower-body garment.[463]\\nThe use of stitched clothes became widespread after Muslim rule was established at first by the Delhi sultanate (c.\\u20091300 CE) and then continued by the Mughal Empire (c.\\u20091525 CE).[464] Among the garments introduced during this time and still commonly worn are: the shalwars and pyjamas, both styles of trousers, and the tunics kurta and kameez.[464] In southern India, the traditional draped garments were to see much longer continuous use.[464]\\n\\nWomen (from left to right) in churidars and kameez (with back to the camera), jeans and sweater, and pink shalwar kameez\\nSalwars are atypically wide at the waist but narrow to a cuffed bottom. They are held up by a drawstring, which causes them to become pleated around the waist.[465] The pants can be wide and baggy, or they can be cut quite narrow, on the bias, in which case they are called churidars. When they are ordinarily wide at the waist and their bottoms are hemmed but not cuffed, they are called pyjamas. The kameez is a long shirt or tunic,[466] its side seams left open below the waistline.[467] The kurta is traditionally collarless and made of cotton or silk; it is worn plain or with embroidered decoration, such as chikan; and typically falls to either just above or just below the wearer\\'s knees.[468]\\nIn the last 50 years, fashions have changed a great deal in India. Increasingly, in urban northern India, the sari is no longer the apparel of everyday wear, though they remain popular on formal occasions.[469] The traditional shalwar kameez is rarely worn by younger urban women, who favour churidars or jeans.[469] In office settings, ubiquitous air conditioning allows men to wear sports jackets year-round.[469] For weddings and formal occasions, men in the middle- and upper classes often wear bandgala, or short Nehru jackets, with pants, with the groom and his groomsmen sporting sherwanis and churidars.[469] The dhoti, once the universal garment of Hindu males, the wearing of which in the homespun and handwoven khadi allowed Gandhi to bring Indian nationalism to the millions,[470]\\nis seldom seen in the cities.[469]\\n\\nCuisine\\nMain article: Indian cuisine\\nSouth Indian vegetarian thali, or platterRailway mutton curry from Odisha\\nThe foundation of a typical Indian meal is a cereal cooked in a plain fashion and complemented with flavourful savoury dishes.[471] The cooked cereal could be steamed rice; chapati, a thin unleavened bread;[472] the idli, a steamed breakfast cake; or dosa, a griddled pancake.[473] The savoury dishes might include lentils, pulses and vegetables commonly spiced with ginger and garlic, but also with a combination of spices that may include coriander, cumin, turmeric, cinnamon, cardamon and others.[471] They might also include poultry, fish, or meat dishes. In some instances, the ingredients might be mixed during the process of cooking.[474]\\nA platter, or thali, used for eating usually has a central place reserved for the cooked cereal, and peripheral ones for the flavourful accompaniments. The cereal and its accompaniments are eaten simultaneously rather than a piecemeal manner. This is accomplished by mixing—for example of rice and lentils—or folding, wrapping, scooping or dipping—such as chapati and cooked vegetables.[471]\\n\\nA tandoor chef in the Turkman Gate, Old Delhi, makes Khameeri roti (a Muslim-influenced style of leavened bread).[475]\\nIndia has distinctive vegetarian cuisines, each a feature of the geographical and cultural histories of its adherents.[476] The appearance of ahimsa, or the avoidance of violence toward all forms of life in many religious orders early in Indian history, especially Upanishadic Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, is thought to have contributed to the predominance of vegetarianism among a large segment of India\\'s Hindu population, especially in southern India, Gujarat, the Hindi-speaking belt of north-central India, as well as among Jains.[476] Although meat is eaten widely in India, the proportional consumption of meat in the overall diet is low.[477] Unlike China, which has increased its per capita meat consumption substantially in its years of increased economic growth, in India the strong dietary traditions have contributed to dairy, rather than meat, becoming the preferred form of animal protein consumption.[478]\\nThe most significant import of cooking techniques into India during the last millennium occurred during the Mughal Empire. Dishes such as the pilaf,[479] developed in the Abbasid caliphate,[480] and cooking techniques such as the marinating of meat in yogurt, spread into northern India from regions to its northwest.[481] To the simple yogurt marinade of Persia, onions, garlic, almonds, and spices began to be added in India.[481] Rice was partially cooked and layered alternately with the sauteed meat, the pot sealed tightly, and slow cooked according to another Persian cooking technique, to produce what has today become biryani,[481] a feature of festive dining in many parts of India.[482] In the food served in Indian restaurants worldwide the diversity of Indian food has been partially concealed by the dominance of Punjabi cuisine. The popularity of tandoori chicken—cooked in the tandoor oven, which had traditionally been used for baking bread in the rural Punjab and the Delhi region, especially among Muslims, but which is originally from Central Asia—dates to the 1950s, and was caused in large part by an entrepreneurial response among people from the Punjab who had been displaced by the 1947 partition.[476]\\n\\nSports and recreation\\nMain article: Sport in India\\nSee also: Indian physical cultureGirls play hopscotch in Jaora, Madhya Pradesh.  Hopscotch has been commonly played by girls in rural India.[483]\\nSeveral traditional sports—such as kabaddi, kho kho, pehlwani, gilli-danda, hopscotch and martial arts such as Kalarippayattu and marma adi—remain popular. Chess is commonly held to have originated in India as chaturaṅga;[484] in recent years, there has been a rise in the number of Indian grandmasters,[485] and world champions.[486] Parcheesi is derived from Pachisi, another traditional Indian pastime, which in early modern times was played on a giant marble court by Mughal emperor Akbar the Great.[487]\\nCricket is the most popular sport in India.[488] India has won two Cricket World Cups, the 1983 edition and the 2011 edition.

Detailed evidence is lacking. Nevertheless, a predecessor of the language that would eventually be called Sanskrit was probably introduced into the north-west sometime between 3,900 and 3,000 years ago. This language was related to one then spoken in eastern Iran; and both of these languages belonged to the Indo-European language family. [...] It seems likely that various small-scale migrations were involved in the gradual introduction of the predecessor language and associated cultural characteristics. However, there may not have been a tight relationship between movements of people on the one hand, and changes in language and culture on the other. Moreover, the process whereby a dynamic new force gradually arose—a people with a distinct ideology who eventually seem to have referred to themselves as \\'Arya\\'—was certainly two-way. That is, it involved a blending of new features which came from outside with other features—probably including some surviving Harappan influences—that were already present. Anyhow, it would be quite a few centuries before Sanskrit was written down. And the hymns and stories of the Arya people—especially the Vedas and the later Mahabharata and Ramayana epics—are poor guides as to historical events.

It not only generated new dishes and entire cuisines, but also fostered novel modes of eating. Such newer trends included the consumption of Persian condiments, which relied heavily on almonds, pastries and quince jams, alongside Indian achars made from sweet limes, green vegetables and curds as side relishes during Mughlai meals.\\n\\n^ Panjabi, Camellia (1995), The Great Curries of India, Simon and Schuster, pp.\\xa0158–, ISBN\\xa0978-0-684-80383-8, The Muslim influenced breads of India are leavened, like naan, Khamiri roti, ...\\n\\n^ a b c Davidson, Alan (2014), The Oxford Companion to Food, Oxford University Press, p.\\xa0410, ISBN\\xa0978-0-19-967733-7\\n\\n^ Sahakian, Marlyne; Saloma, Czarina; Erkman, Suren (2016), Food Consumption in the City: Practices and patterns in urban Asia and the Pacific, Taylor & Francis, p.\\xa050, ISBN\\xa0978-1-317-31050-1\\n\\n^ OECD; Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (2018), OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook 2018–2027, OECD Publishing, p.\\xa021, ISBN\\xa0978-92-64-06203-0\\n\\n^ Roger 2000.\\n\\n^ Sengupta, Jayanta (2014), \"India\", in Freedman, Paul; Chaplin, Joyce E.; Albala, Ken (eds.), Food in Time and Place: The American Historical Association Companion to Food History, University of California Press, p.\\xa074, ISBN\\xa0978-0-520-27745-8\\n\\n^ a b c Collingham, Elizabeth M.

It is the seventh-largest country by area; the most populous country from June 2023 onwards;[22][23] and since its independence in 1947, the world\\'s most populous democracy.[24][25][26] Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west;[k] China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is near Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand, Myanmar, and Indonesia.\\nModern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago.[28][29][30] Their long occupation, predominantly in isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse, second only to Africa in human genetic diversity.[31] Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE.[32] By 1200\\xa0BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit, an Indo-European language, had diffused into India from the northwest.[33][34] Its hymns recorded the dawning of Hinduism in India.[35] India\\'s pre-existing Dravidian languages were supplanted in the northern regions.[36] By 400\\xa0BCE, caste had emerged within Hinduism,[37] and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity.[38] Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires.[39] Widespread creativity suffused this era,[40] but the status of women declined,[41] and untouchability became an organized belief.[l][42] In South India, the Middle kingdoms exported Dravidian language scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms of Southeast Asia.[43]\\nIn the early mediaeval era, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism became established on India\\'s southern and western coasts.[44] Muslim armies from Central Asia intermittently overran India\\'s northern plains.[45] The resulting Delhi Sultanate drew northern India into the cosmopolitan networks of mediaeval Islam.[46] In south India, the Vijayanagara Empire created a long-lasting composite Hindu culture.[47] In the Punjab, Sikhism emerged, rejecting institutionalised religion.[48] The Mughal Empire, in 1526, ushered in two centuries of relative peace,[49] leaving a legacy of luminous architecture.[m][50] Gradually expanding rule of the British East India Company  turned India into a colonial economy but consolidated its sovereignty.[51] British Crown rule began in 1858. The rights promised to Indians were granted slowly,[52][53] but technological changes were introduced, and modern ideas of education and public life took root.[54] A pioneering and influential nationalist movement, noted for nonviolent resistance, became the major factor in ending British rule.[55][56] In 1947, the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two independent dominions,[57][58][59][60] a Hindu-majority dominion of India and a Muslim-majority dominion of Pakistan. A large-scale loss of life and an unprecedented migration accompanied the partition.[61]\\nIndia has been a federal republic since 1950, governed through a democratic parliamentary system. It is a pluralistic, multilingual and multi-ethnic society. India\\'s population grew from 361 million in 1951 to over 1.4\\xa0billion in 2023.[62]\\nDuring this time, its nominal per capita income increased from US$64 annually to US$2,601, and its literacy rate from 16.6% to 74%. A comparatively destitute country in 1951,[63] India has become a fast-growing major economy and hub for information technology services; it has an expanding middle class.[64] Indian movies and music increasingly influence global culture.[65] India has reduced its poverty rate, though at the cost of increasing economic inequality.[66] It is a nuclear-weapon state that ranks high in military expenditure. It has disputes over Kashmir with its neighbours, Pakistan and China, unresolved since the mid-20th century.[67] Among the socio-economic challenges India faces are gender inequality, child malnutrition,[68] and rising levels of air pollution.[69] India\\'s land is megadiverse with four biodiversity hotspots.[70] India\\'s wildlife, which has traditionally been viewed with tolerance in its culture,[71] is supported in protected habitats.\\n\\n\\nEtymology\\nMain article: Names for India\\nAccording to the Oxford English Dictionary (2009), the name \"India\" is derived from the Classical Latin India, a reference to South Asia and an uncertain region to its east. In turn \"India\" derived successively from Hellenistic Greek India ( Ἰνδία), ancient Greek Indos ( Ἰνδός), Old Persian Hindush (an eastern province of the Achaemenid Empire), and ultimately its cognate, the Sanskrit Sindhu, or \"river\", specifically the Indus River and, by implication, its well-settled southern basin.[72][73] The ancient Greeks referred to the Indians as Indoi, \"The people of the Indus\".[74]\\nThe term Bharat (Bhārat; pronounced [ˈbʱaːɾət] ⓘ), mentioned in both Indian epic poetry and the Constitution of India,[75][76] is used in its variations by many Indian languages. A modern rendering of the historical name Bharatavarsha, which applied originally to North India,[77][78] Bharat gained increased currency from the mid-19th century as a native name for India.[75][79]\\nHindustan ([ɦɪndʊˈstaːn] ⓘ) is a Middle Persian name for India that became popular by the 13th century,[80] and was used widely since the era of the Mughal Empire. The meaning of Hindustan has varied, referring to a region encompassing the northern Indian subcontinent (present-day northern India and Pakistan) or to India in its near entirety.[75][79][81]\\n\\nHistory\\nMain articles: History of India and History of the Republic of India\\nAncient India\\nManuscript illustration, c.\\u20091650, of the Sanskrit epic Ramayana, composed in story-telling fashion c.\\u2009400\\xa0BCE\\xa0– c.\\u2009300\\xa0CE[82]\\nBy 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans, or Homo sapiens, had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa.[28][29][30] The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years ago.[28] After 6500\\xa0BCE, evidence for domestication of food crops and animals, construction of permanent structures, and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in Balochistan, Pakistan.[83] These gradually developed into the Indus Valley Civilisation,[84][83] the first urban culture in South Asia,[85] which flourished during 2500–1900\\xa0BCE in Pakistan and western India.[86] Centred around cities such as Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, Dholavira, and Kalibangan, and relying on varied forms of subsistence, the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and wide-ranging trade.[85]\\nDuring the period 2000–500\\xa0BCE, many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the Chalcolithic cultures to the Iron Age ones.[87] The Vedas, the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism,[88] were composed during this period,[89] and historians have analysed these to posit a Vedic culture in the Punjab region and the upper Gangetic Plain.[87] Most historians also consider this period to have encompassed several waves of Indo-Aryan migration into the subcontinent from the north-west.[88] The caste system, which created a hierarchy of priests, warriors, and free peasants, but which excluded indigenous peoples by labelling their occupations impure, arose during this period.[90] On the Deccan Plateau, archaeological evidence from this period suggests the existence of a chiefdom stage of political organisation.[87] In South India, a progression to sedentary life is indicated by the large number of megalithic monuments dating from this period,[91] as well as by nearby traces of agriculture, irrigation tanks, and craft traditions.[91]\\n\\nCave 26 of the rock-cut Ajanta Caves\\nIn the late Vedic period, around the 6th century BCE, the small states and chiefdoms of the Ganges Plain and the north-western regions had consolidated into 16 major oligarchies and monarchies that were known as the mahajanapadas.[92][93] The emerging urbanisation gave rise to non-Vedic religious movements, two of which became independent religions. Jainism came into prominence during the life of its exemplar, Mahavira.[94] Buddhism, based on the teachings of Gautama Buddha, attracted followers from all social classes excepting the middle class; chronicling the life of the Buddha was central to the beginnings of recorded history in India.[95][96][97] In an age of increasing urban wealth, both religions held up renunciation as an ideal,[98] and both established long-lasting monastic traditions. Politically, by the 3rd century BCE, the kingdom of Magadha had annexed or reduced other states to emerge as the Maurya Empire.[99] The empire was once thought to have controlled most of the subcontinent except the far south, but its core regions are now thought to have been separated by large autonomous areas.[100][101] The Mauryan kings are known as much for their empire-building and determined management of public life as for Ashoka\\'s renunciation of militarism and far-flung advocacy of the Buddhist dhamma.[102][103]\\nThe Sangam literature of the Tamil language reveals that, between 200\\xa0BCE and 200\\xa0CE, the southern peninsula was ruled by the Cheras, the Cholas, and the Pandyas, dynasties that traded extensively with the Roman Empire and with West and Southeast Asia.[104][105] In North India, Hinduism asserted patriarchal control within the family, leading to increased subordination of women.[106][99] By the 4th and 5th centuries, the Gupta Empire had created a complex system of administration and taxation in the greater Ganges Plain; this system became a model for later Indian kingdoms.[107][108] Under the Guptas, a renewed Hinduism based on devotion, rather than the management of ritual, began to assert itself.[109] This renewal was reflected in a flowering of sculpture and architecture, which found patrons among an urban elite.[108] Classical Sanskrit literature flowered as well, and Indian science, astronomy, medicine, and mathematics made significant advances.[108]\\n\\nMedieval India\\nMain article: Medieval India\\nBrihadeshwara temple, Thanjavur, completed in 1010\\xa0CEThe Qutub Minar, 73\\xa0m (240\\xa0ft) tall, completed by the Sultan of Delhi, Iltutmish\\nThe Indian early medieval age, from 600 to 1200\\xa0CE, is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity.[110] When Harsha of Kannauj, who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from 606 to 647\\xa0CE, attempted to expand southwards, he was defeated by the Chalukya ruler of the Deccan.[111] When his successor attempted to expand eastwards, he was defeated by the Pala king of Bengal.[111] When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards, they were defeated by the Pallavas from farther south, who in turn were opposed by the Pandyas and the Cholas from still farther south.[111] No ruler of this period was able to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond their core region.[110] During this time, pastoral peoples, whose land had been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy, were accommodated within caste society, as were new non-traditional ruling classes.[112] The caste system consequently began to show regional differences.[112]\\nIn the 6th and 7th centuries, the first devotional hymns were created in the Tamil language.[113] They were imitated all over India and led to both the resurgence of Hinduism and the development of all modern languages of the subcontinent.[113] Indian royalty, big and small, and the temples they patronised drew citizens in great numbers to the capital cities, which became economic hubs as well.[114] Temple towns of various sizes began to appear everywhere as India underwent another urbanisation.[114] By the 8th and 9th centuries, the effects were felt in Southeast Asia, as South Indian culture and political systems were exported to lands that became part of modern-day Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Brunei, Cambodia, Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia.[115] Indian merchants, scholars, and sometimes armies were involved in this transmission; Southeast Asians took the initiative as well, with many sojourning in Indian seminaries and translating Buddhist and Hindu texts into their languages.[115]\\nAfter the 10th century, Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans, using swift-horse cavalry and raising vast armies united by ethnicity and religion, repeatedly overran South Asia\\'s north-western plains, leading eventually to the establishment of the Islamic Delhi Sultanate in 1206.[116] The sultanate was to control much of North India and to make many forays into South India. Although at first disruptive for the Indian elites, the sultanate largely left its vast non-Muslim subject population to its own laws and customs.[117][118] By repeatedly repulsing Mongol raiders in the 13th century, the sultanate saved India from the devastation visited on West and Central Asia, setting the scene for centuries of migration of fleeing soldiers, learned men, mystics, traders, artists, and artisans from that region into the subcontinent, thereby creating a syncretic Indo-Islamic culture in the north.[119][120] The sultanate\\'s raiding and weakening of the regional kingdoms of South India paved the way for the indigenous Vijayanagara Empire.[121] Embracing a strong Shaivite tradition and building upon the military technology of the sultanate, the empire came to control much of peninsular India,[122] and was to influence South Indian society for long afterwards.[121]\\n\\nEarly modern India\\nIn the early 16th century, northern India, then under mainly Muslim rulers,[123] fell again to the superior mobility and firepower of a new generation of Central Asian warriors.[124] The resulting Mughal Empire did not stamp out the local societies it came to rule. Instead, it balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices[125][126] and diverse and inclusive ruling elites,[127] leading to more systematic, centralised, and uniform rule.[128] Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic identity, especially under Akbar, the Mughals united their far-flung realms through loyalty, expressed through a Persianised culture, to an emperor who had near-divine status.[127] The Mughal state\\'s economic policies, deriving most revenues from agriculture[129] and mandating that taxes be paid in the well-regulated silver currency,[130] caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets.[128] The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a factor in India\\'s economic expansion,[128] resulting in greater patronage of painting, literary forms, textiles, and architecture.[131] Newly coherent social groups in northern and western India, such as the Marathas, the Rajputs, and the Sikhs, gained military and governing ambitions during Mughal rule, which, through collaboration or adversity, gave them both recognition and military experience.[132] Expanding commerce during Mughal rule gave rise to new Indian commercial and political elites along the coasts of southern and eastern India.[132] As the empire disintegrated, many among these elites were able to seek and control their own affairs.[133]\\n\\nA distant view of the Taj Mahal from the Agra FortA two mohur Company gold coin, issued in 1835, the obverse inscribed \"William IIII, King\"\\nBy the early 18th century, with the lines between commercial and political dominance being increasingly blurred, a number of European trading companies, including the English East India Company, had established coastal outposts.[134][135] The East India Company\\'s control of the seas, greater resources, and more advanced military training and technology led it to increasingly assert its military strength and caused it to become attractive to a portion of the Indian elite; these factors were crucial in allowing the company to gain control over the Bengal region by 1765 and sideline the other European companies.[136][134][137][138] Its further access to the riches of Bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to annex or subdue most of India by the 1820s.[139] India was then no longer exporting manufactured goods as it long had, but was instead supplying the British Empire with raw materials. Many historians consider this to be the onset of India\\'s colonial period.[134] By this time, with its economic power severely curtailed by the British parliament and having effectively been made an arm of British administration, the East India Company began more consciously to enter non-economic arenas, including education, social reform, and culture.[140]\\n\\nModern India\\nMain article: History of India (1947–present)\\nHistorians consider India\\'s modern age to have begun sometime between 1848 and 1885. The appointment in 1848 of Lord Dalhousie as Governor General of the East India Company set the stage for changes essential to a modern state. These included the consolidation and demarcation of sovereignty, the surveillance of the population, and the education of citizens. Technological changes—among them, railways, canals, and the telegraph—were introduced not long after their introduction in Europe.[141][142][143][144] However, disaffection with the company also grew during this time and set off the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Fed by diverse resentments and perceptions, including invasive British-style social reforms, harsh land taxes, and summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes, the rebellion rocked many regions of northern and central India and shook the foundations of Company rule.[145][146] Although the rebellion was suppressed by 1858, it led to the dissolution of the East India Company and the direct administration of India by the British government. Proclaiming a unitary state and a gradual but limited British-style parliamentary system, the new rulers also protected princes and landed gentry as a feudal safeguard against future unrest.[147][148] In the decades following, public life gradually emerged all over India, leading eventually to the founding of the Indian National Congress in 1885.[149][150][151][152]\\nThe rush of technology and the commercialisation of agriculture in the second half of the 19th century was marked by economic setbacks, and many small farmers became dependent on the whims of far-away markets.[153] There was an increase in the number of large-scale famines,[154] and, despite the risks of infrastructure development borne by Indian taxpayers, little industrial employment was generated for Indians.[155] There were also salutary effects: commercial cropping, especially in the newly canalled Punjab, led to increased food production for internal consumption.[156] The railway network provided critical famine relief,[157] notably reduced the cost of moving goods,[157] and helped nascent Indian-owned industry.[156]\\n\\n1909 map of the British Indian EmpireJawaharlal Nehru sharing a light moment with Mahatma Gandhi, Mumbai, 6 July 1946\\nAfter World War I, in which approximately one million Indians served,[158] a new period began. It was marked by British reforms but also repressive legislation, by more strident Indian calls for self-rule, and by the beginnings of a nonviolent movement of non-co-operation, of which Mahatma Gandhi would become the leader and enduring symbol.[159] During the 1930s, slow legislative reform was enacted by the British; the Indian National Congress won victories in the resulting elections.[160] The next decade was beset with crises: Indian participation in World War\\xa0II, the Congress\\'s final push for non-co-operation, and an upsurge of Muslim nationalism. All were capped by the advent of independence in 1947, but tempered by the partition of India into two states: India and Pakistan.[161]\\nVital to India\\'s self-image as an independent nation was its constitution, completed in 1950, which put in place a secular and democratic republic.[162]  Economic liberalisation, which began in the 1980s and the collaboration with Soviet Union for technical know-how,[163] has created a large urban middle class, transformed India into one of the world\\'s fastest-growing economies,[164] and increased its geopolitical clout. Yet, India is also shaped by seemingly unyielding poverty, both rural and urban;[165] by religious and caste-related violence;[166] by Maoist-inspired Naxalite insurgencies;[167] and by separatism in Jammu and Kashmir and in Northeast India.[168] It has unresolved territorial disputes with China[169] and with Pakistan.[169] India\\'s sustained democratic freedoms are unique among the world\\'s newer nations; however, in spite of its recent economic successes, freedom from want for its disadvantaged population remains a goal yet to be achieved.[170]\\n\\nGeography\\nMain article: Geography of India\\nIndia accounts for the bulk of the Indian subcontinent, lying atop the Indian tectonic plate, a part of the Indo-Australian Plate.[171] India\\'s defining geological processes began 75 million years ago when the Indian Plate, then part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana, began a north-eastward drift caused by seafloor spreading to its south-west, and later, south and south-east.[171] Simultaneously, the vast Tethyan oceanic crust, to its northeast, began to subduct under the Eurasian Plate.[171] These dual processes, driven by convection in the Earth\\'s mantle, both created the Indian Ocean and caused the Indian continental crust eventually to under-thrust Eurasia and to uplift the Himalayas.[171] Immediately south of the emerging Himalayas, plate movement created a vast crescent-shaped trough that rapidly filled with river-borne sediment[172] and now constitutes the Indo-Gangetic Plain.[173] The original Indian plate makes its first appearance above the sediment in the ancient Aravalli range, which extends from the Delhi Ridge in a southwesterly direction. To the west lies the Thar Desert, the eastern spread of which is checked by the Aravallis.[174][175][176]\\n\\nThe Tungabhadra, with rocky outcrops, flows into the peninsular Krishna River.[177]Fishing boats lashed together in a tidal creek in Anjarle village, Maharashtra\\nThe remaining Indian Plate survives as peninsular India, the oldest and geologically most stable part of India. It extends as far north as the Satpura and Vindhya ranges in central India. These parallel chains run from the Arabian Sea coast in Gujarat in the west to the coal-rich Chota Nagpur Plateau in Jharkhand in the east.[178] To the south, the remaining peninsular landmass, the Deccan Plateau, is flanked on the west and east by coastal ranges known as the Western and Eastern Ghats;[179] the plateau contains the country\\'s oldest rock formations, some over one billion years old. Constituted in such fashion, India lies to the north of the equator between 6° 44′ and 35° 30′ north latitude[n] and 68° 7′ and 97° 25′ east longitude.[180]\\nIndia\\'s coastline measures 7,517 kilometres (4,700\\xa0mi) in length; of this distance, 5,423 kilometres (3,400\\xa0mi) belong to peninsular India and 2,094 kilometres (1,300\\xa0mi) to the Andaman, Nicobar, and Lakshadweep island chains.[181] According to the Indian naval hydrographic charts, the mainland coastline consists of the following: 43% sandy beaches; 11% rocky shores, including cliffs; and 46% mudflats or marshy shores.[181]\\nMajor Himalayan-origin rivers that substantially flow through India include the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, both of which drain into the Bay of Bengal.[182] Important tributaries of the Ganges include the Yamuna and the Kosi; the latter\\'s extremely low gradient, caused by long-term silt deposition, leads to severe floods and course changes.[183][184] Major peninsular rivers, whose steeper gradients prevent their waters from flooding, include the Godavari, the Mahanadi, the Kaveri, and the Krishna, which also drain into the Bay of Bengal;[185] and the Narmada and the Tapti, which drain into the Arabian Sea.[186] Coastal features include the marshy Rann of Kutch of western India and the alluvial Sundarbans delta of eastern India; the latter is shared with Bangladesh.[187] India has two archipelagos: the Lakshadweep, coral atolls off India\\'s south-western coast; and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a volcanic chain in the Andaman Sea.[188]\\nIndian climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter monsoons.[189] The Himalayas prevent cold Central Asian katabatic winds from blowing in, keeping the bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes.[190][191] The Thar Desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moisture-laden south-west summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India\\'s rainfall.[189] Four major climatic groupings predominate in India: tropical wet, tropical dry, subtropical humid, and montane.[192]\\nTemperatures in India have risen by 0.7\\xa0°C (1.3\\xa0°F) between 1901 and 2018.[193] Climate change in India is often thought to be the cause. The retreat of Himalayan glaciers has adversely affected the flow rate of the major Himalayan rivers, including the Ganges and the Brahmaputra.[194] According to some current projections, the number and severity of droughts in India will have markedly increased by the end of the present century.[195]\\n\\nBiodiversity\\nMain articles: Forestry in India and Wildlife of India\\nIndia is a megadiverse country, a term employed for 17 countries that display high biological diversity and contain many species exclusively indigenous, or endemic, to them.[196] India is the habitat for 8.6% of all mammals, 13.7% of bird species, 7.9% of reptile species, 6% of amphibian species, 12.2% of fish species, and 6.0% of all flowering plant species.[197][198] Fully a third of Indian plant species are endemic.[199] India also contains four of the world\\'s 34 biodiversity hotspots,[70] or regions that display significant habitat loss in the presence of high endemism.[o][200]\\nIndia\\'s most dense forests, such as the tropical moist forest of the Andaman Islands, the Western Ghats, and Northeast India, occupy approximately 3% of its land area.[201][202] Moderately dense forest, whose canopy density is between 40% and 70%, occupies 9.39% of India\\'s land area.[201][202] It predominates in the temperate coniferous forest of the Himalayas, the moist deciduous sal forest of eastern India, and the dry deciduous teak forest of central and southern India.[203] India has two natural zones of thorn forest, one in the Deccan Plateau, immediately east of the Western Ghats, and the other in the western part of the Indo-Gangetic plain, now turned into rich agricultural land by irrigation, its features no longer visible.[204]\\nAmong the Indian subcontinent\\'s notable indigenous trees are the astringent Azadirachta indica, or neem, which is widely used in rural Indian herbal medicine,[205] and the luxuriant Ficus religiosa, or peepul,[206] which is displayed on the ancient seals of Mohenjo-daro,[207] and under which the Buddha is recorded in the Pali canon to have sought enlightenment.[208]\\nMany Indian species have descended from those of Gondwana, the southern supercontinent from which India separated more than 100 million years ago.[209] India\\'s subsequent collision with Eurasia set off a mass exchange of species. However, volcanism and climatic changes later caused the extinction of many endemic Indian forms.[210] Still later, mammals entered India from Asia through two zoogeographic passes flanking the Himalayas.[211] This had the effect of lowering endemism among India\\'s mammals, which stands at 12.6%, contrasting with 45.8% among reptiles and 55.8% among amphibians.[198] Among endemics are the vulnerable[212] hooded leaf monkey[213] and the threatened[214] Beddome\\'s toad[214][215] of the Western Ghats.\\nIndia contains 172 IUCN-designated threatened animal species, or 2.9% of endangered forms.[216] These include the endangered Bengal tiger and the Ganges river dolphin. Critically endangered species include the gharial, a crocodilian; the great Indian bustard; and the Indian white-rumped vulture, which has become nearly extinct by having ingested the carrion of diclofenac-treated cattle.[217] Before they were extensively used for agriculture and cleared for human settlement, the thorn forests of Punjab were mingled at intervals with open grasslands that were grazed by large herds of blackbuck preyed on by the Asiatic cheetah; the blackbuck, no longer extant in Punjab, is now severely endangered in India, and the cheetah is extinct.[218] The pervasive and ecologically devastating human encroachment of recent decades has critically endangered Indian wildlife. In response, the system of national parks and protected areas, first established in 1935, was expanded substantially. In 1972, India enacted the Wildlife Protection Act[219] and Project Tiger to safeguard crucial wilderness; the Forest Conservation Act was enacted in 1980 and amendments added in 1988.[220] India hosts more than five hundred wildlife sanctuaries and eighteen\\xa0biosphere reserves,[221] four of which are part of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves; seventy-five wetlands are registered under the Ramsar Convention.[222]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIndia has the majority of the world\\'s wild tigers, approximately 3,170 in 2022.[223]\\n\\n\\n\\nA chital (Axis axis) stag in the Nagarhole National Park in a region covered by a moderately dense[p] forest.\\n\\n\\n\\nThree of the last Asiatic cheetahs in India were shot dead in 1948 in Surguja district, Madhya Pradesh, Central India by Maharajah Ramanuj Pratap Singh Deo.

Since then, however, it has increasingly shared the political stage with the BJP,[231] as well as with powerful regional parties which have often forced the creation of multi-party coalition governments at the center.[232]\\nIn the Republic of India\\'s first three general elections, in 1951, 1957, and 1962, the Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru-led Congress won easy victories. On Nehru\\'s death in 1964, Lal Bahadur Shastri briefly became prime minister; he was succeeded, after his own unexpected death in 1966, by Nehru\\'s daughter Indira Gandhi, who went on to lead the Congress to election victories in 1967 and 1971. Following public discontent with the state of emergency she declared in 1975, the Congress was voted out of power in 1977; the then-new Janata Party, which had opposed the emergency, was voted in. Its government lasted just over two years. There were two prime ministers during this period; Morarji Desai and Charan Singh. Voted back into power in 1980, the Congress saw a change in leadership in 1984, when Indira Gandhi was assassinated; she was succeeded by her son Rajiv Gandhi, who won an easy victory in the general elections later that year. The Congress was voted out again in 1989 when a National Front coalition, led by the newly formed Janata Dal in alliance with the Left Front, won the elections; that government too proved relatively short-lived, lasting just under two years. There were two prime ministers during this period; V.P. Singh and Chandra Shekhar.[233] Elections were held again in 1991; no party won an absolute majority. The Congress, as the largest single party, was able to form a minority government led by P. V. Narasimha Rao.[234]\\n\\nUS president Barack Obama addresses the members of the Parliament of India in New Delhi in November 2010.\\nA two-year period of political turmoil followed the general election of 1996. Several short-lived alliances shared power at the centre. The BJP formed a government briefly in 1996; it was followed by two comparatively long-lasting United Front coalitions, which depended on external support. There were two prime ministers during this period; H.D. Deve Gowda and I.K. Gujral. In 1998, the BJP was able to form a successful coalition, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). Led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the NDA became the first non-Congress, coalition government to complete a five-year term.[235] Again in the 2004 Indian general elections, no party won an absolute majority, but the Congress emerged as the largest single party, forming another successful coalition: the United Progressive Alliance (UPA). It had the support of left-leaning parties and MPs who opposed the BJP. The UPA returned to power in the 2009 general election with increased numbers, and it no longer required external support from India\\'s communist parties.[236] That year, Manmohan Singh became the first prime minister since Jawaharlal Nehru in 1957 and 1962 to be re-elected to a consecutive five-year term.[237] In the 2014 general election, the BJP became the first political party since 1984 to win a majority and govern without the support of other parties.[238] In the 2019 general election, the BJP was victorious again with majority. In the 2024 general election, the BJP failed to achieve majority and the BJP-led NDA coalition formed the government. Narendra Modi, a former chief minister of Gujarat, is serving as the prime minister of India in his third term since May 26, 2014.[239]\\n\\nGovernment\\nMain articles: Government of India and Constitution of India\\nRashtrapati Bhavan, the official residence of the President of India, was designed by British architects Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker for the Viceroy of India, and constructed between 1911 and 1931 during the British Raj.[240]\\nIndia is a federation with a parliamentary system governed under the Constitution of India—the country\\'s supreme legal document. It is a constitutional republic. Federalism in India defines the power distribution between the union and the states. The Constitution of India, which came into effect on 26 January 1950,[241] originally stated India to be a \"democratic republic;\" this characterisation was amended in 1971 to a \"socialist, secular, democratic republic\".[242] India\\'s form of government, traditionally described as \"quasi-federal\" with a strong centre and weak states,[243] has grown increasingly federal since the late 1990s as a result of political, economic, and social changes.[244][245]\\nThe Government of India comprises three branches: the Executive, Legislature, and Judiciary.[246] The President of India is the ceremonial head of state,[247] who is elected indirectly for a five-year term by an electoral college comprising members of national and state legislatures.[248][249] The Prime Minister of India is the head of government and exercises most executive power.[250] Appointed by the president,[251] the prime minister is by convention supported by the party or political alliance having a majority of seats in the lower house of parliament.[250] The executive of the Indian government consists of the president, the vice-president, and the Union Council of Ministers—with the cabinet being its executive committee—headed by the prime minister. Any minister holding a portfolio must be a member of one of the houses of parliament.[247] In the Indian parliamentary system, the executive is subordinate to the legislature; the prime minister and their council are directly responsible to the lower house of the parliament. Civil servants act as permanent executives and all decisions of the executive are implemented by them.[252]\\nThe legislature of India is the bicameral parliament. Operating under a Westminster-style parliamentary system, it comprises an upper house called the Rajya Sabha (Council of States) and a lower house called the Lok Sabha (House of the People).[253] The Rajya Sabha is a permanent body of 245\\xa0members who serve staggered six-year terms with elections every 2 years.[254] Most are elected indirectly by the state and union territorial legislatures in numbers proportional to their state\\'s share of the national population.[251] The Lok Sabha\\'s 543\\xa0members are elected directly by popular vote among citizens aged at least 18;[255] they represent single-member constituencies for five-year\\xa0terms.[256] The Indian constitution historically allowed for the nomination of Anglo-Indians to two seats in the Lok Sabha; this provision was removed in 2019.[255][257] A number of seats from each state are reserved for candidates from Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in proportion to their population within that state.[255]\\nIndia has a three-tier\\xa0unitary independent judiciary[258] comprising the supreme court, headed by the Chief Justice of India, 25\\xa0high courts, and a large number of trial courts.[258] The supreme court has original jurisdiction over cases involving fundamental rights and over disputes between states and the centre and has appellate jurisdiction over the high courts.[259] It has the power to both strike down union or state laws which contravene the constitution[260] and invalidate any government action it deems unconstitutional.[261]\\n\\nAdministrative divisions\\nMain article: Administrative divisions of India\\nSee also: Political integration of India\\nIndia is a federal union comprising 28 states and 8 union territories.[12] All states, as well as the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, Puducherry and the National Capital Territory of Delhi, have elected legislatures and governments following the Westminster system. The remaining five union territories are directly ruled by the central government through appointed administrators. In 1956, under the States Reorganisation Act, states were reorganised on a linguistic basis.[262] There are over a quarter of a million local government bodies at city, town, block, district and village levels.[263]\\n\\nA clickable map of the 28 states and 8 union territories of India\\nStates\\n\\nAndhra Pradesh\\nArunachal Pradesh\\nAssam\\nBihar\\nChhattisgarh\\nGoa\\nGujarat\\nHaryana\\nHimachal Pradesh\\nJharkhand\\nKarnataka\\nKerala\\nMadhya Pradesh\\nMaharashtra\\nManipur\\nMeghalaya\\nMizoram\\nNagaland\\nOdisha\\nPunjab\\nRajasthan\\nSikkim\\nTamil Nadu\\nTelangana\\nTripura\\nUttar Pradesh\\nUttarakhand\\nWest Bengal\\nUnion territories\\nAndaman and Nicobar IslandsChandigarhDadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and DiuJammu and KashmirLadakhLakshadweepNational Capital Territory of DelhiPuducherry\\nForeign, economic, and strategic relations\\nMain articles: Foreign relations of India and Indian Armed Forces\\nDuring the 1950s and 60s, India played a pivotal role in the Non-Aligned Movement.[264] From left to right: Gamal Abdel Nasser of United Arab Republic (now Egypt), Josip Broz Tito of Yugoslavia and Jawaharlal Nehru in Belgrade, September 1961.\\nIndia became a republic in 1950 and chose to stay in the Commonwealth of Nations.[265][266] Throughout the decade, India strongly supported decolonisation in Africa and Asia and played a leading role in the Non-Aligned Movement.[267] After initially cordial relations with neighbouring China, India went to war with China in 1962 and was widely thought to have been humiliated.[268] This was followed by another military conflict in 1967 in which India successfully repelled Chinese attack.[269] India has had tense relations with neighbouring Pakistan. The two have gone to war four times: in 1947, 1965, 1971, and 1999. Three of these wars were fought over the disputed territory of Kashmir, while the third, the 1971 war, followed from India\\'s support for the independence of Bangladesh.[270] In the late 1980s, the Indian military twice intervened abroad at the invitation of the host country: a peace-keeping operation in Sri Lanka between 1987 and 1990; and an armed intervention to prevent a 1988 coup d\\'état attempt in the Maldives. After the 1965 war with Pakistan, India began to pursue close military and economic ties with the Soviet Union; by the late 1960s, the Soviet Union was its largest arms supplier.[271]\\nAside from its ongoing special relationship with Russia,[272] India has wide-ranging defence relations with Israel and France. In recent years, it has played key roles in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation and the World Trade Organization. The nation has provided 100,000 military and police personnel to serve in 35 UN peacekeeping operations across four continents. It participates in the East Asia Summit, the G8+5, and other multilateral forums.[273] India has close economic ties with countries in South America,[274] Asia, and Africa; it pursues a \"Look East\" policy that seeks to strengthen partnerships with the ASEAN nations, Japan, and South Korea that revolve around many issues, but especially those involving economic investment and regional security.[275][276]\\n\\nThe Indian Air Force contingent marching at the 221st Bastille Day military parade in Paris, on 14 July 2009.

Despite criticism and military sanctions, India has signed neither the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty nor the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, considering both to be flawed and discriminatory.[279] India maintains a \"no first use\" nuclear policy and is developing a nuclear triad capability as a part of its \"Minimum Credible Deterrence\" doctrine.[280][281] It is developing a ballistic missile defence shield and, a fifth-generation fighter jet.[282][283] Other indigenous military projects involve the design and implementation of Vikrant-class aircraft carriers and Arihant-class nuclear submarines.[284]\\nIndia is estimated to possess up to 172 nuclear warheads, and is considered to be producing both highly enriched uranium (HEU) and weapons-grade plutonium, with its HEU production assumed to be focused on its growing number of nuclear-powered vessels\\' and submarines\\' fuels.[285][286] Kristensen et al. of Nuclear Information Project with the Federation of American Scientists estimate that India is operating eight nuclear-capable systems as of 2024, including aircraft, land-based and sea-based ballistic missile systems, with most of its programs in development thought to be nearing \"completion and to be fielded with the armed forces soon\".[285]\\nSince the end of the Cold War, India has increased its economic, strategic, and military co-operation with the United States and the European Union.[287] In 2008, a civilian nuclear agreement was signed between India and the United States. Although India possessed nuclear weapons at the time and was not a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, it received waivers from the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Nuclear Suppliers Group, ending earlier restrictions on India\\'s nuclear technology and commerce. As a consequence, India became the sixth de facto nuclear weapons state.[288] India subsequently signed co-operation agreements involving civilian nuclear energy with Russia,[289] France,[290] the United Kingdom,[291] and Canada.[292]\\n\\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi of India (left, background) in talks with President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico during a visit to Mexico, 2016\\nThe President of India is the supreme commander of the nation\\'s armed forces; with 1.45\\xa0million active troops, they compose the world\\'s second-largest military.

Widespread state intervention and regulation largely walled the economy off from the outside world. An acute balance of payments crisis in 1991 forced the nation to liberalise its economy;[308] since then, it has moved increasingly towards a free-market system[309][310] by emphasising both foreign trade and direct investment inflows.[311] India has been a member of World Trade Organization since 1 January 1995.[312]\\nThe 522-million-worker Indian labour force is the world\\'s second largest, as of 2017[update].[293] The service sector makes up 55.6% of GDP, the industrial sector 26.3% and the agricultural sector 18.1%. India\\'s foreign exchange remittances of US$100 billion in 2022,[313] highest in the world, were contributed to its economy by 32 million Indians working in foreign countries.[314] Major agricultural products include rice, wheat, oilseed, cotton, jute, tea, sugarcane, and potatoes.[12] Major industries include textiles, telecommunications, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, food processing, steel, transport equipment, cement, mining, petroleum, machinery, and software.[12] In 2006, the share of external trade in India\\'s GDP stood at 24%, up from 6% in 1985.[309] In 2008, India\\'s share of world trade was 1.7%;[315] In 2021, India was the world\\'s ninth-largest importer and the sixteenth-largest exporter.[316] Major exports include petroleum products, textile goods, jewellery, software, engineering goods, chemicals, and manufactured leather goods.[12] Major imports include crude oil, machinery, gems, fertiliser, and chemicals.[12] Between 2001 and 2011, the contribution of petrochemical and engineering goods to total exports grew from 14% to 42%.[317] India was the world\\'s second-largest textile exporter after China in the 2013 calendar year.[318]\\nAveraging an economic growth rate of 7.5% for several years prior to 2007,[309] India has more than doubled its hourly wage rates during the first decade of the 21st century.[319] Some 431 million Indians have left poverty since 1985; India\\'s middle classes are projected to number around 580\\xa0million by 2030.[320] Though ranking 68th in global competitiveness,[321] as of 2010[update], India ranks 17th in financial market sophistication, 24th in the banking sector, 44th in business sophistication, and 39th in innovation, ahead of several advanced economies.[322] With seven of the world\\'s top 15 information technology outsourcing companies based in India, as of 2009[update], the country is viewed as the second-most favourable outsourcing destination after the United States.[323] India is ranked 39th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024.[324] In 2023, India\\'s consumer market was the world\\'s fifth largest.[325]\\nDriven by growth, India\\'s nominal GDP per capita increased steadily from US$308 in 1991, when economic liberalisation began, to US$1,380 in 2010, to an estimated US$2,731 in 2024.

The number of people living in urban areas grew by 31.2% between 1991 and 2001.[365] Yet, in 2001, over 70% still lived in rural areas.[366][367] The level of urbanisation increased further from 27.81% in the 2001 Census to 31.16% in the 2011 Census. The slowing down of the overall population growth rate was due to the sharp decline in the growth rate in rural areas since 1991.[368] According to the 2011 census, there are 53 million-plus urban agglomerations in India; among them Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad, in decreasing order by population.[369] The literacy rate in 2011 was 74.04%: 65.46% among females and 82.14% among males.[370] The rural-urban literacy gap, which was 21.2 percentage points in 2001, dropped to 16.1 percentage points in 2011. The improvement in the rural literacy rate is twice that of urban areas.[368] Kerala is the most literate state with 93.91% literacy; while Bihar the least with 63.82%.[370]\\n\\nThe interior of San Thome Basilica, Chennai, Tamil Nadu.

India has no national language.[371] Hindi, with the largest number of speakers, is the official language of the government.[372][373] English is used extensively in business and administration and has the status of a \"subsidiary official language\";[6] it is important in education, especially as a medium of higher education. Each state and union territory has one or more official languages, and the constitution recognises in particular 22 \"scheduled languages\".\\nThe 2011 census reported the religion in India with the largest number of followers was Hinduism (79.80% of the population), followed by Islam (14.23%); the remaining were Christianity (2.30%), Sikhism (1.72%), Buddhism (0.70%), Jainism (0.36%) and others[r] (0.9%).[11] India has the third-largest Muslim population—the largest for a non-Muslim majority country.[374][375]\\n\\nCulture\\nMain article: Culture of India\\nA Sikh pilgrim at the Harmandir Sahib, or Golden Temple, in Amritsar, Punjab\\nIndian cultural history spans more than 4,500 years.[376] During the Vedic period (c.\\u20091700\\xa0BCE\\xa0– c.\\u2009500\\xa0BCE), the foundations of Hindu philosophy, mythology, theology and literature were laid, and many beliefs and practices which still exist today, such as dhárma, kárma, yóga, and mokṣa, were established.[74] India is notable for its religious diversity, with Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Islam, Christianity, and Jainism among the nation\\'s major religions.[377] The predominant religion, Hinduism, has been shaped by various historical schools of thought, including those of the Upanishads,[378] the Yoga Sutras, the Bhakti movement,[377] and by Buddhist philosophy.[379]\\n\\nVisual art\\nMain article: Indian art\\nIndia has a very ancient tradition of art, which has exchanged many influences with the rest of Eurasia, especially in the first millennium, when Buddhist art spread with Indian religions to Central, East and Southeast Asia, the last also greatly influenced by Hindu art.[380] Thousands of seals from the Indus Valley Civilization of the third millennium BCE have been found, usually carved with animals, but a few with human figures. The \"Pashupati\" seal, excavated in Mohenjo-daro, Pakistan, in 1928–29, is the best known.[381][382] After this there is a long period with virtually nothing surviving.[382][383] Almost all surviving ancient Indian art thereafter is in various forms of religious sculpture in durable materials, or coins. There was probably originally far more in wood, which is lost. In north India Mauryan art is the first imperial movement.[384][385][386] In the first millennium CE, Buddhist art spread with Indian religions to Central, East and Southeast Asia, the last also greatly influenced by Hindu art.[387] Over the following centuries a distinctly Indian style of sculpting the human figure developed, with less interest in articulating precise anatomy than ancient Greek sculpture but showing smoothly flowing forms expressing prana (\"breath\" or life-force).[388][389] This is often complicated by the need to give figures multiple arms or heads, or represent different genders on the left and right of figures, as with the Ardhanarishvara form of Shiva and Parvati.[390][391]\\nMost of the earliest large sculpture is Buddhist, either excavated from Buddhist stupas such as Sanchi, Sarnath and Amaravati,[392] or is rock cut reliefs at sites such as Ajanta, Karla and Ellora. Hindu and Jain sites appear rather later.[393][394] In spite of this complex mixture of religious traditions, generally, the prevailing artistic style at any time and place has been shared by the major religious groups, and sculptors probably usually served all communities.[395] Gupta art, at its peak c.\\u2009300\\xa0CE\\xa0– c.\\u2009500\\xa0CE, is often regarded as a classical period whose influence lingered for many centuries after; it saw a new dominance of Hindu sculpture, as at the Elephanta Caves.[396][397] Across the north, this became rather stiff and formulaic after c.\\u2009800\\xa0CE, though rich with finely carved detail in the surrounds of statues.[398] But in the South, under the Pallava and Chola dynasties, sculpture in both stone and bronze had a sustained period of great achievement; the large bronzes with Shiva as Nataraja have become an iconic symbol of India.[399][400]\\nAncient painting has only survived at a few sites, of which the crowded scenes of court life in the Ajanta Caves are by far the most important, but it was evidently highly developed, and is mentioned as a courtly accomplishment in Gupta times.[401][402] Painted manuscripts of religious texts survive from Eastern India about the 10th century onwards, most of the earliest being Buddhist and later Jain. No doubt the style of these was used in larger paintings.[403] The Persian-derived Deccan painting, starting just before the Mughal miniature, between them give the first large body of secular painting, with an emphasis on portraits, and the recording of princely pleasures and wars.[404][405] The style spread to Hindu courts, especially among the Rajputs, and developed a variety of styles, with the smaller courts often the most innovative, with figures such as Nihâl Chand and Nainsukh.[406][407] As a market developed among European residents, it was supplied by Company painting by Indian artists with considerable Western influence.[408][409] In the 19th century, cheap Kalighat paintings of gods and everyday life, done on paper, were urban folk art from Calcutta, which later saw the Bengal School of Art, reflecting the art colleges founded by the British, the first movement in modern Indian painting.[410][411]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBhutesvara Yakshis, Buddhist reliefs from Mathura, 2nd century\\xa0CE\\n\\n\\n\\nGupta terracotta relief, Krishna Killing the Horse Demon Keshi, 5th century\\n\\n\\n\\nElephanta Caves, triple-bust (trimurti) of Shiva, 18 feet (5.5\\xa0m) tall, c.\\u2009550\\n\\n\\n\\nChola bronze of Shiva as Nataraja (\"Lord of Dance\"), Tamil Nadu, 10th or 11th century\\n\\n\\n\\nJahangir Receives Prince Khurram at Ajmer on His Return from the Mewar Campaign, Balchand, c.\\u20091635\\n\\n\\n\\nKrishna Fluting to the Milkmaids, Kangra painting, 1775–1785\\n\\n\\nArchitecture\\nMain article: Architecture of India\\nThe Taj Mahal from across the Yamuna river showing two outlying red sandstone buildings, a mosque on the right (west) and a jawab (response) thought to have been built for architectural balance\\nMuch of Indian architecture, including the Taj Mahal, other works of Indo-Islamic Mughal architecture, and South Indian architecture, blends ancient local traditions with imported styles.[412] Vernacular architecture is also regional in its flavours. Vastu shastra, literally \"science of construction\" or \"architecture\" and ascribed to Mamuni Mayan,[413] explores how the laws of nature affect human dwellings;[414] it employs precise geometry and directional alignments to reflect perceived cosmic constructs.[415] As applied in Hindu temple architecture, it is influenced by the Shilpa Shastras, a series of foundational texts whose basic mythological form is the Vastu-Purusha mandala, a square that embodied the \"absolute\".[416] The Taj Mahal, built in Agra between 1631 and 1648 by orders of Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife, has been described in the UNESCO World Heritage List as \"the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world\\'s heritage\".[417] Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture, developed by the British in the late 19th century, drew on Indo-Islamic architecture.[418]\\n\\nLiterature\\nMain article: Indian literature\\nThe earliest literature in India, composed between 1500\\xa0BCE and 1200\\xa0CE, was in the Sanskrit language.[419] Major works of Sanskrit literature include the Rigveda (c.\\u20091500\\xa0BCE\\xa0– c.\\u20091200\\xa0BCE), the epics: Mahābhārata (c.\\u2009400\\xa0BCE\\xa0– c.\\u2009400\\xa0CE) and the Ramayana (c.\\u2009300\\xa0BCE and later); Abhijñānaśākuntalam (The Recognition of Śakuntalā, and other dramas of Kālidāsa (c.\\u20095th century\\xa0CE) and Mahākāvya poetry.[420][421][422] In Tamil literature, the Sangam literature (c.\\u2009600\\xa0BCE\\xa0– c.\\u2009300\\xa0BCE) consisting of 2,381 poems, composed by 473 poets, is the earliest work.[423][424][425][426] From the 14th to the 18th centuries, India\\'s literary traditions went through a period of drastic change because of the emergence of devotional poets like Kabīr, Tulsīdās, and Guru Nānak. This period was characterised by a varied and wide spectrum of thought and expression; as a consequence, medieval Indian literary works differed significantly from classical traditions.[427] In the 19th century, Indian writers took a new interest in social questions and psychological descriptions. In the 20th century, Indian literature was influenced by the works of Rabindranath Tagore,[428] who was a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature.\\n\\nPerforming arts and media\\nMain articles: Music of India, Dance in India, Cinema of India, and Television in India\\nIndia\\'s National Academy of Performance Arts has recognised eight Indian dance styles to be classical.  One such is Kuchipudi shown here.\\nIndian music ranges over various traditions and regional styles. Classical music encompasses two genres and their various folk offshoots: the northern Hindustani and the southern Carnatic schools.[429] Regionalised popular forms include filmi and folk music; the syncretic tradition of the bauls is a well-known form of the latter. Indian dance also features diverse folk and classical forms. Among the better-known folk dances are: bhangra of Punjab, bihu of Assam, Jhumair and chhau of Jharkhand, Odisha and West Bengal, garba and dandiya of Gujarat, ghoomar of Rajasthan, and lavani of Maharashtra. Eight dance forms, many with narrative forms and mythological elements, have been accorded classical dance status by India\\'s National Academy of Music, Dance, and Drama. These are: bharatanatyam of the state of Tamil Nadu, kathak of Uttar Pradesh, kathakali and mohiniyattam of Kerala, kuchipudi of Andhra Pradesh, manipuri of Manipur, odissi of Odisha, and the sattriya of Assam.[430]\\nTheatre in India melds music, dance, and improvised or written dialogue.[431] Often based on Hindu mythology, but also borrowing from medieval romances or social and political events, Indian theatre includes: the bhavai of Gujarat, the jatra of West Bengal, the nautanki and ramlila of North India, tamasha of Maharashtra, burrakatha of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, terukkuttu of Tamil Nadu, and the yakshagana of Karnataka.[432] India has a theatre training institute, the National School of Drama (NSD), in New Delhi.[433]\\nThe Indian film industry produces the world\\'s most-watched cinema.[434] Established regional cinematic traditions exist in the Assamese, Bengali, Bhojpuri, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Punjabi, Gujarati, Marathi, Odia, Tamil, and Telugu languages.[435] The Hindi language film industry (Bollywood) is the largest sector representing 43% of box office revenue, followed by the South Indian Telugu and Tamil film industries which represent 36% combined.[436]\\nTelevision broadcasting began in India in 1959 as a state-run medium of communication and expanded slowly for more than two decades.[437][438] The state monopoly on television broadcast ended in the 1990s. Since then, satellite channels have increasingly shaped the popular culture of Indian society.[439] Today, television is the most penetrative media in India; industry estimates indicate that as of 2012[update] there are over 554 million TV consumers, 462\\xa0million with satellite or cable connections compared to other forms of mass media such as the press (350\\xa0million), radio (156\\xa0million) or internet (37\\xa0million).[440]\\n\\nSociety\\nMuslims offer namaz at a mosque in Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir.\\nTraditional Indian society is sometimes defined by social hierarchy. The Indian caste system embodies much of the social stratification and many of the social restrictions found on the Indian subcontinent. Social classes are defined by thousands of endogamous hereditary groups, often termed as jātis, or \"castes\".[441] India abolished untouchability in 1950 with the adoption of the constitution and has since enacted other anti-discriminatory laws and social welfare initiatives.\\nFamily values are important in the Indian tradition, and multi-generational patrilineal joint families have been the norm in India, though nuclear families are becoming common in urban areas.[442] An overwhelming majority of Indians, with their consent, have their marriages arranged by their parents or other family elders.[443] Marriage is thought to be for life,[443] and the divorce rate is extremely low,[444] with less than one in a thousand marriages ending in divorce.[445] Child marriages are common, especially in rural areas; many women wed before reaching 18, which is their legal marriageable age.[446] Female infanticide in India, and lately female foeticide, have created skewed gender ratios; the number of missing women in the country quadrupled from 15 million to 63\\xa0million in the 50-year period ending in 2014, faster than the population growth during the same period.[447] According to an Indian government study, an additional 21 million girls are unwanted and do not receive adequate care.[448] Despite a government ban on sex-selective foeticide, the practice remains commonplace in India, the result of a preference for boys in a patriarchal society.[449] The payment of dowry, although illegal, remains widespread across class lines.[450] Deaths resulting from dowry, mostly from bride burning, are on the rise, despite stringent anti-dowry laws.[451]\\nMany Indian festivals are religious in origin. The best known include Diwali, Ganesh Chaturthi, Thai Pongal, Holi, Durga Puja, Eid ul-Fitr, Bakr-Id, Christmas, and Vaisakhi.[452][453]\\n\\nEducation\\nMain articles: Education in India, Literacy in India, and History of education in the Indian subcontinent\\nChildren awaiting school lunch in Rayka (also Raika), a village in rural Gujarat. The salutation Jai Bhim written on the blackboard honours the jurist, social reformer, and Dalit leader B. R. Ambedkar.\\nIn the 2011 census, about 73% of the population was literate, with 81% for men and 65% for women. This compares to 1981 when the respective rates were 41%, 53% and 29%. In 1951 the rates were 18%, 27% and 9%. In 1921 the rates 7%, 12% and 2%. In 1891 they were 5%, 9% and 1%,[454][455] According to Latika Chaudhary, in 1911 there were under three primary schools for every ten villages. Statistically, more caste and religious diversity reduced private spending. Primary schools taught literacy, so local diversity limited its growth.[456]\\nThe education system of India is the world\\'s second-largest.[457] India has over 900 universities, 40,000 colleges[458] and 1.5\\xa0million schools.[459] In India\\'s higher education system, a significant number of seats are reserved under affirmative action policies for the historically disadvantaged. In recent decades India\\'s improved education system is often cited as one of the main contributors to its economic development.[460][461]\\n\\nClothing\\nMain article: Clothing in India\\nWomen in sari at an adult literacy class in Tamil NaduA man in dhoti and wearing a woollen shawl, in Varanasi\\nFrom ancient times until the advent of the modern, the most widely worn traditional dress in India was draped.[462] For women it took the form of a sari, a single piece of cloth many yards long.[462] The sari was traditionally wrapped around the lower body and the shoulder.[462] In its modern form, it is combined with an underskirt, or Indian petticoat, and tucked in the waist band for more secure fastening. It is also commonly worn with an Indian blouse, or choli, which serves as the primary upper-body garment, the sari\\'s end—passing over the shoulder—covering the midriff and obscuring the upper body\\'s contours.[462] For men, a similar but shorter length of cloth, the dhoti, has served as a lower-body garment.[463]\\nThe use of stitched clothes became widespread after Muslim rule was established at first by the Delhi sultanate (c.\\u20091300 CE) and then continued by the Mughal Empire (c.\\u20091525 CE).[464] Among the garments introduced during this time and still commonly worn are: the shalwars and pyjamas, both styles of trousers, and the tunics kurta and kameez.[464] In southern India, the traditional draped garments were to see much longer continuous use.[464]\\n\\nWomen (from left to right) in churidars and kameez (with back to the camera), jeans and sweater, and pink shalwar kameez\\nSalwars are atypically wide at the waist but narrow to a cuffed bottom. They are held up by a drawstring, which causes them to become pleated around the waist.[465] The pants can be wide and baggy, or they can be cut quite narrow, on the bias, in which case they are called churidars. When they are ordinarily wide at the waist and their bottoms are hemmed but not cuffed, they are called pyjamas. The kameez is a long shirt or tunic,[466] its side seams left open below the waistline.[467] The kurta is traditionally collarless and made of cotton or silk; it is worn plain or with embroidered decoration, such as chikan; and typically falls to either just above or just below the wearer\\'s knees.[468]\\nIn the last 50 years, fashions have changed a great deal in India. Increasingly, in urban northern India, the sari is no longer the apparel of everyday wear, though they remain popular on formal occasions.[469] The traditional shalwar kameez is rarely worn by younger urban women, who favour churidars or jeans.[469] In office settings, ubiquitous air conditioning allows men to wear sports jackets year-round.[469] For weddings and formal occasions, men in the middle- and upper classes often wear bandgala, or short Nehru jackets, with pants, with the groom and his groomsmen sporting sherwanis and churidars.[469] The dhoti, once the universal garment of Hindu males, the wearing of which in the homespun and handwoven khadi allowed Gandhi to bring Indian nationalism to the millions,[470]\\nis seldom seen in the cities.[469]\\n\\nCuisine\\nMain article: Indian cuisine\\nSouth Indian vegetarian thali, or platterRailway mutton curry from Odisha\\nThe foundation of a typical Indian meal is a cereal cooked in a plain fashion and complemented with flavourful savoury dishes.[471] The cooked cereal could be steamed rice; chapati, a thin unleavened bread;[472] the idli, a steamed breakfast cake; or dosa, a griddled pancake.[473] The savoury dishes might include lentils, pulses and vegetables commonly spiced with ginger and garlic, but also with a combination of spices that may include coriander, cumin, turmeric, cinnamon, cardamon and others.[471] They might also include poultry, fish, or meat dishes. In some instances, the ingredients might be mixed during the process of cooking.[474]\\nA platter, or thali, used for eating usually has a central place reserved for the cooked cereal, and peripheral ones for the flavourful accompaniments. The cereal and its accompaniments are eaten simultaneously rather than a piecemeal manner. This is accomplished by mixing—for example of rice and lentils—or folding, wrapping, scooping or dipping—such as chapati and cooked vegetables.[471]\\n\\nA tandoor chef in the Turkman Gate, Old Delhi, makes Khameeri roti (a Muslim-influenced style of leavened bread).[475]\\nIndia has distinctive vegetarian cuisines, each a feature of the geographical and cultural histories of its adherents.[476] The appearance of ahimsa, or the avoidance of violence toward all forms of life in many religious orders early in Indian history, especially Upanishadic Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, is thought to have contributed to the predominance of vegetarianism among a large segment of India\\'s Hindu population, especially in southern India, Gujarat, the Hindi-speaking belt of north-central India, as well as among Jains.[476] Although meat is eaten widely in India, the proportional consumption of meat in the overall diet is low.[477] Unlike China, which has increased its per capita meat consumption substantially in its years of increased economic growth, in India the strong dietary traditions have contributed to dairy, rather than meat, becoming the preferred form of animal protein consumption.[478]\\nThe most significant import of cooking techniques into India during the last millennium occurred during the Mughal Empire. Dishes such as the pilaf,[479] developed in the Abbasid caliphate,[480] and cooking techniques such as the marinating of meat in yogurt, spread into northern India from regions to its northwest.[481] To the simple yogurt marinade of Persia, onions, garlic, almonds, and spices began to be added in India.[481] Rice was partially cooked and layered alternately with the sauteed meat, the pot sealed tightly, and slow cooked according to another Persian cooking technique, to produce what has today become biryani,[481] a feature of festive dining in many parts of India.[482] In the food served in Indian restaurants worldwide the diversity of Indian food has been partially concealed by the dominance of Punjabi cuisine. The popularity of tandoori chicken—cooked in the tandoor oven, which had traditionally been used for baking bread in the rural Punjab and the Delhi region, especially among Muslims, but which is originally from Central Asia—dates to the 1950s, and was caused in large part by an entrepreneurial response among people from the Punjab who had been displaced by the 1947 partition.[476]\\n\\nSports and recreation\\nMain article: Sport in India\\nSee also: Indian physical cultureGirls play hopscotch in Jaora, Madhya Pradesh.  Hopscotch has been commonly played by girls in rural India.[483]\\nSeveral traditional sports—such as kabaddi, kho kho, pehlwani, gilli-danda, hopscotch and martial arts such as Kalarippayattu and marma adi—remain popular. Chess is commonly held to have originated in India as chaturaṅga;[484] in recent years, there has been a rise in the number of Indian grandmasters,[485] and world champions.[486] Parcheesi is derived from Pachisi, another traditional Indian pastime, which in early modern times was played on a giant marble court by Mughal emperor Akbar the Great.[487]\\nCricket is the most popular sport in India.[488] India has won two Cricket World Cups, the 1983 edition and the 2011 edition. India has won eight field hockey gold medals in the summer Olympics.[489]\\nIndia has participated in shooting sports and has won several medals at the Olympics, the World Shooting Championships, and the Commonwealth Games.[490][491] Other sports in which Indians have succeeded internationally include badminton,[492] boxing,[493] and wrestling.[494] Football is popular in West Bengal, Goa, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and the north-eastern states. The major domestic league is the Indian Premier League. Professional leagues in other sports include the Indian Super League (football) and the Pro Kabaddi League.[495][496][497]\\n\\nSee also\\nAdministrative divisions of India\\nOutline of India\\nPortals: India Countries Asia\\nNotes\\n\\n\\n^ Originally written in Sanskritised Bengali and adopted as the national anthem in its Hindi translation\\n\\n^ \"[...] Jana Gana Mana is the National Anthem of India, subject to such alterations in the words as the Government may authorise as occasion arises; and the song Vande Mataram, which has played a historic part in the struggle for Indian freedom, shall be honoured equally with Jana Gana Mana and shall have equal status with it.\"[5]\\n\\n^ Written in a mixture of Sanskrit and Sanskritised Bengali\\n\\n^ According to Part XVII of the Constitution of India, Hindi in the Devanagari script is the official language of the Union, along with English as an additional official language.[1][6][7] States and union territories can have a different official language of their own other than Hindi or English.\\n\\n^ Not all the state-level official languages are in the eighth schedule and not all the scheduled languages are state-level official languages.

Texts that record Aryan culture are not precisely datable, but they seem to begin around 1200 BCE with four collections of Vedic hymns (Rg, Sama, Yajur, and Artharva).\";(d) Dyson 2018, pp.\\xa014–15, \"Although the collapse of the Indus valley civilization is no longer believed to have been due to an \\'Aryan invasion\\' it is widely thought that, at roughly the same time, or perhaps a few centuries later, new Indo-Aryan-speaking people and influences began to enter the subcontinent from the north-west. Detailed evidence is lacking. Nevertheless, a predecessor of the language that would eventually be called Sanskrit was probably introduced into the north-west sometime between 3,900 and 3,000 years ago. This language was related to one then spoken in eastern Iran; and both of these languages belonged to the Indo-European language family. [...] It seems likely that various small-scale migrations were involved in the gradual introduction of the predecessor language and associated cultural characteristics. However, there may not have been a tight relationship between movements of people on the one hand, and changes in language and culture on the other. Moreover, the process whereby a dynamic new force gradually arose—a people with a distinct ideology who eventually seem to have referred to themselves as \\'Arya\\'—was certainly two-way. That is, it involved a blending of new features which came from outside with other features—probably including some surviving Harappan influences—that were already present. Anyhow, it would be quite a few centuries before Sanskrit was written down. And the hymns and stories of the Arya people—especially the Vedas and the later Mahabharata and Ramayana epics—are poor guides as to historical events. Of course, the emerging Arya were to have a huge impact on the history of the subcontinent. Nevertheless, little is known about their early presence.\";  (e) Robb 2011, pp.\\xa046–, \"The expansion of Aryan culture is supposed to have begun around 1500 BCE. It should not be thought that this Aryan emergence (though it implies some migration) necessarily meant either a sudden invasion of new peoples, or a complete break with earlier traditions. It comprises a set of cultural ideas and practices, upheld by a Sanskrit-speaking elite, or Aryans. The features of this society are recorded in the Vedas.\"\\n\\n^ (a) Jamison, Stephanie; Brereton, Joel (2020), The Rigveda, Oxford University Press, pp.\\xa02, 4, ISBN\\xa0978-0-19-063339-4, The RgVeda is one of the four Vedas, which together constitute the oldest texts in Sanskrit and the earliest evidence for what will become Hinduism.

Although samskaras vary from region to region, from class (varna) to class, and from caste to caste, their core elements remain the same owing to the common source, the Veda, and a common priestly tradition preserved by the Brahmin priests.

She also demonstrates that the new national states of India and Pakistan were quickly drawn into trying to stem this migration.

In this manner, Central Asian cooking merged with older traditions within the subcontinent, to create such signature dishes as biryani (a fusion of the Persian pilau and the spice-laden dishes of Hindustan),  and the Kashmiri meat stew of Rogan Josh. It not only generated new dishes and entire cuisines, but also fostered novel modes of eating. Such newer trends included the consumption of Persian condiments, which relied heavily on almonds, pastries and quince jams, alongside Indian achars made from sweet limes, green vegetables and curds as side relishes during Mughlai meals.\\n\\n^ Panjabi, Camellia (1995), The Great Curries of India, Simon and Schuster, pp.\\xa0158–, ISBN\\xa0978-0-684-80383-8, The Muslim influenced breads of India are leavened, like naan, Khamiri roti, ...\\n\\n^ a b c Davidson, Alan (2014), The Oxford Companion to Food, Oxford University Press, p.\\xa0410, ISBN\\xa0978-0-19-967733-7\\n\\n^ Sahakian, Marlyne; Saloma, Czarina; Erkman, Suren (2016), Food Consumption in the City: Practices and patterns in urban Asia and the Pacific, Taylor & Francis, p.\\xa050, ISBN\\xa0978-1-317-31050-1\\n\\n^ OECD; Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (2018), OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook 2018–2027, OECD Publishing, p.\\xa021, ISBN\\xa0978-92-64-06203-0\\n\\n^ Roger 2000.\\n\\n^ Sengupta, Jayanta (2014), \"India\", in Freedman, Paul; Chaplin, Joyce E.; Albala, Ken (eds.), Food in Time and Place: The American Historical Association Companion to Food History, University of California Press, p.\\xa074, ISBN\\xa0978-0-520-27745-8\\n\\n^ a b c Collingham, Elizabeth M.

Introduction\\nRecently, pre-trained large language models (LLMs) (Tou-\\nvron et al., 2023a;b; Brown et al., 2020) have demonstrated\\nremarkable capabilities in performing intricate reasoning\\ntasks (Kojima et al., 2022). These tasks include problem-\\nsolving with world knowledge (Hendrycks et al., 2020;\\nSuzgun et al., 2022), logical reasoning (Pan et al., 2023),\\nand solving mathematical problems (Cobbe et al., 2021;\\nHendrycks et al., 2021). These models are typically not ex-\\n1Department of Computer Science, University of Califor-\\nnia, Santa Barbara 2Language Technologies Institute, Carnegie\\nMellon University\\n3Cheriton School of Computer Science,\\nUniversity of Waterloo.\\nCorrespondence to:\\nXinyi Wang\\n<xinyi wang@ucsb.edu>.\\nPreprint.\\n1We open source the code at https://github.com/\\nWANGXinyiLinda/LM_random_walk\\nFigure 1. We hypothesize that the pre-training corpus can be\\nviewed as generated from random walks on a reasoning graph\\nover world knowledge/concepts. With each node si representing\\nconcepts, pj can be viewed as arguments that connect them. Then\\nwe hypothesize that a language model (LM) training on such a\\ncorpus can be viewed as reasoning by a weighted aggregation of\\nrandom walk paths that connect the entities in interest.

Recent research (Jain\\net al., 2023) also suggests that the supervised fine-tuning\\nprocess following pre-training only learns a wrapper on top\\nof the already existing model capabilities, instead of learn-\\ning new ones. It is intriguing to understand how next-token\\nprediction pre-training contributes to the emergence of such\\nreasoning capability. A better understanding of this matter\\ncan also inspire new pre-training/fine-tuning techniques to\\nimprove these important abilities of LLMs.\\nIt is well-known that LLMs acquire emergent abilities\\nthrough extensive pre-training (Wei et al., 2022a). In this\\npaper, we focus on elucidating the emergence of reason-\\ning ability — the capacity to draw novel conclusions from\\nexisting knowledge, which has been less studied. Many\\nrecent works also attempt to understand this phenomenon.\\nSome works focus on understanding Transformers’ reason-\\ning capability by construction (Liu et al., 2023; Chi et al.,\\n2023; Feng et al., 2023). Others try to provide post hoc\\nmechanistic explanations (Geiger et al., 2021; Wu et al.,\\n1\\narXiv:2402.03268v2  [cs.LG]  29 Feb 2024\\nUnderstanding the Reasoning Ability of Language Models From the Perspective of Reasoning Paths Aggregation\\n2023; Hanna et al., 2023) or understanding inference time\\nin-context learning reasoning (Li et al., 2023; Razeghi et al.,\\n2022; Wang et al., 2023). Our study is more relevant to the\\nline of work analyzing the contribution of pre-training data\\nto LM reasoning (Bi et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023; Xiao &\\nLiu, 2023; Zhou et al., 2023; Ramesh et al., 2023).\\nIn contrast to these works, we adopt a Bayesian view and\\ntry to understand why next-token-prediction pre-training\\ncan unlock LMs’ reasoning ability. More specifically, we\\nhypothesize that LMs can aggregate the indirect reason-\\ning paths seen at pre-training time, through the next-token-\\nprediction training objective. In a real-world scenario, the\\nreasoning path can be a piece of text argument connecting\\ntwo concepts. We hypothesize that, at inference time, this\\nenables an LM to jump from one concept to another during\\nits reasoning process, which could be verbalized by generat-\\ning chain-of-thought (CoT) solutions (Wei et al., 2022b), or\\nsilent without generating outputs.\\nPrystawski et al. (2023) propose a different hypothesis that\\nlocalized structure on dependencies between variables in\\ntraining data is important for LM reasoning, especially CoT\\nreasoning. Our hypothesis implies a similar property of\\nthe pre-training data: when two concepts are related by\\na reasoning path, they are highly likely to cooccur in the\\ndata and thus form a graph-like localized structure. One\\ndrawback of Prystawski et al. (2023)’s work is that their\\nexperiments equate reasoning to conditional probability es-\\ntimation of boolean variables with intermediate variables,\\nwhich can be considered overly simplified compared to real-\\nworld reasoning processes. In our paper, we aim to produce\\na more realistic analysis of the effect of training data by\\nclosely examining two predominant types of reasoning: log-\\nical reasoning and mathematical reasoning. In these two\\nreasoning scenarios, we first construct unsupervised random\\nwalk paths, which are used to (continually) pre-train the LM\\nwith next-token loss. Then we adopt the pre-trained LM to\\nperform reasoning tasks on unseen examples.\\nFor logical reasoning, we analyze a straightforward yet gen-\\neral reasoning scenario: reasoning over knowledge graphs.\\nA knowledge graph (KG) stores facts in the form of triples\\n(e1, r, e2), where e1 and e2 represent entities connected by\\nthe relationship r. KGs can be incomplete, lacking certain\\nrelations between existing entities. These missing relations\\ncan typically be inferred from the known triples stored in the\\nKG by employing logical rules. For instance, the relation\\n(A, isGrandChildof, C) can be derived from the triples\\n(A, isSonOf, B) and (B, isSonOf, C). We formalize a\\nreasoning path as a random walk path on the KG, which\\nenables us to accurately compute its probability. We show\\nthat an LM pre-trained from scratch on random walk paths\\ngenerated from a given KG can accurately deduce missing\\nrelation connections. We also analyze the KL divergence\\nbetween LM output distributions and weighted/unweighted\\nsums of random walk path probabilities, which are vari-\\nances of the classic path ranking algorithm (PRA) (Lao\\net al., 2011). Our analysis suggests that the LM distribution\\nshares many similarities with aggregating the probabilities\\nof possible random walk paths in a logical-rule-aware man-\\nner, and is usually superior to them.\\nFor mathematical reasoning, we focus on a more complex\\ncase of reasoning: solving math word problems (MWPs).\\nSince it is very challenging to pre-train an LM from scratch\\nto perform well on MWPs, which require both math deduc-\\ntion and language understanding, we propose to continue\\ntraining on a pre-trained base LM. Based on the insights ob-\\ntained from the KG reasoning analysis, We propose to create\\nrandom walk reasoning paths from existing CoT train-\\ning data, and test the effectiveness of next-token-prediction\\ntraining on these unlabeled reasoning paths. More specif-\\nically, we construct a reasoning graph by regarding the\\nreasoning state at each CoT step as the graph node. Then we\\nreorder and reconnect the existing CoT steps to form the ran-\\ndom walk paths on the graph. Experiment results on three\\nMWP datasets, GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), AQUA (Ling\\net al., 2017), SVAMP (Patel et al., 2021), show consistent\\nimprovement compared to vanilla supervised fine-tuning,\\nand a similar effect of random walk path length as in the\\nKG reasoning case is observed.\\nOur findings can be summarized as follows: (a) We show in\\nboth reasoning scenarios that our weighted random walk rea-\\nsoning paths aggregation hypothesis is one (of many) valid\\nways to explain how LMs may gain their reasoning ability;\\n(b) We show that LMs can utilize unlabeled reasoning paths\\nhighly efficiently and show the potential of incorporating\\nthe random walk idea to real-world (continue) pre-training.\\n2. Logical Reasoning\\nWe first analyze a well-controlled case of logic reasoning,\\nknowledge graph (KG) reasoning, by pre-training a small\\nTransformer over random walk paths from KGs. The KL\\ndivergence between aggregated random walk path probabil-\\nities and LM distribution shows that LM is very close to a\\nweighted aggregation. We also show that KL divergence\\nreflects how LMs assign weights to logical rules. We find\\nthat there is usually an optimal random walk path length\\nfor training LMs. These observations support our reasoning\\npaths aggregation hypothesis.\\n2.1. Problem setting\\nConsider a knowledge graph G = {(ei\\n1, ri, ei\\n2)}N\\ni=1 consist-\\ning of N triples, such that the head entity ei\\n1 and tail entity\\nei\\n2 are related by ri for all i. Let R denote the set of all pos-\\nsible relations and E denote the set of all entities. Our goal\\n2\\nUnderstanding the Reasoning Ability of Language Models From the Perspective of Reasoning Paths Aggregation\\nis to predict a set of unseen triples T = {(ej\\n1, rj, ej\\n2)}m\\nj=1,\\nej\\n1, ej\\n2 ∈E, rj ∈R, by training a Transformer based gen-\\nerative language model (LM) from scratch on the given\\nknowledge graph G. To translate a triple into a sentence (i.e.\\na sequence of tokens), We add each entity ei and relation ri\\nas a new token (<e i> and <r i>) to the Transformer’s vo-\\ncabulary and translate each triple into a three-token sentence\\n“<e i> <r j> <e k>.”. In this way, we avoid using any\\nnatural language thus no semantic meaning of the entity or\\nrelation name will affect the LM prediction.\\n2.2. Language Model Pre-training\\nWe construct the training data by performing random walks\\non the given KG G. More specifically, we randomly sample\\na start entity e ∼U(E), where U(·) denotes the uniform\\ndistribution. Then we perform a random walk on G from e\\nby sampling the next node with e′ ∼U(C(e)), and stop at\\na maximum path length Lmax.\\nThen we translate each triple into a sentence and concatenate\\nall the sentences in the sampled random walk path to become\\na paragraph. The paragraphs are then concatenated together\\nand separated by the special end-of-sequence token to form\\ntext chunks of the same length. The training loss function is\\nthe next-token prediction loss:\\nLLM(θ) =\\nX\\nD\\nT\\nX\\nt=1\\nlog\\nexp (fθ(wt+1|w1:t))\\nP\\nw∈V exp (fθ(w|w1:t))\\n(1)\\nHere, θ denotes the LM parameters 2. wi ∈V represents a\\ntoken in the LM vocabulary V, and w1:T is a token sequence\\nin the training data D, where T is the length of a text chunk.\\nTo test the reasoning ability of a pre-trained LM, we format\\nthe testing triples as sentence completion tasks. For example,\\nthe triple (e1, r, e2) will be translated to the prompt “<e 1>\\n<r>) ”, and let the LM predict the next token, then verify\\nthe prediction with the ground truth e2. Note that, here the\\nraw LM output distribution is over all entities and relations.\\nTo make the LM distribution more well-defined and simplify\\nthe following analysis, we take the LM output logits over\\nall entities and define the LM output distribution as:\\nPLM(e2|e1, r) =\\nexp (fθ(e2|e1, r))\\nP\\ne∈E exp (fθ(e|e1, r))\\n(2)\\n2.3. Random Walk Paths Aggregation\\nRecall that our hypothesis is LM can aggregate the reason-\\ning paths seen at the pre-training time. In the KG setting,\\nwe can explicitly define how the reasoning/random walk\\npaths are aggregated. Inspired by the classic path ranking\\n2We use a randomly initialized GPT-2 model (Radford et al.,\\n2019).\\nalgorithm PRA (Lao et al., 2011), we define the aggrega-\\ntion of random walk paths Pw as the exponential of a\\nweighted sum of the probabilities of all appropriate random\\nwalk paths connecting the two target entities. More specif-\\nically, we are interested in a distribution Pw(e2|e1, r) for\\nunseen (e1, r, e2) in the form of:\\nPw(e2|e1, r) =\\nexp(Sw(e2|e1, r)/T)\\nP\\ne∈E exp(Sw(e|e1, r)/T)\\n(3)\\nHere Sw(e2|e1, r) is a score/logits of e2. T > 0 is a tem-\\nperature to rescale the weighted logits Sw so that it can\\nmatch the scale of LM logits fθ 3, and that Pw(e2|e1, r) and\\nPLM(e2|e1, r) are more comparable. The score Sw(e2|e1, r)\\nis defined to be a weighted sum of the probability of follow-\\ning all possible logical rules going from e1 to e2:\\nSw(e2|e1, r) =\\nX\\nh∈H\\nwr(h)P(e2|e1, h)\\nHere H denotes the set of all possible logical rules, and\\nh ∈H is a specific logical rule. wr(h) is the weight as-\\nsigned to rule h when inferring relation r. For example, a\\nrule for inferring the locatedIn relation can be h : (e1,\\nneighborOf, e3) ∧(e3, locatedIn, e2). Formally, for\\na target relation r, we consider logic rules with conjunctive\\nform. ∀{ei}n\\ni=0 ⊂E,\\n(e0, r, en) ←(e0, r1, e1) ∧(e1, r2, e2) ∧... ∧(en−1, rn, en)\\nwhere (ei−1, ri, ei) ∈G. We abbreviate such rule by h =\\n[r1, r2, ..., rn]. We can formalize the set of all possible logic\\nrules by H = {[r1, r2, ..., rn]|n ≥1, ri ∈R}.\\nThen the probability of following a specific logic rule h ∈H\\nbetween e1 and e2 during the random walk would be the\\nsum of the probability of all possible random walk paths\\nfrom e1 to e2 following the rule h = [r1, r2, ..., rn]:\\nP(en|e0, h) =\\nX\\n(e0,r1,e1)...(en−1,rn,en)∈Ph\\nn\\nY\\ni=1\\nP(ei|ei−1, ri)\\nwhere Ph denotes all paths from the KG following h. Fol-\\nlowing the pre-training data generation, we perform a uni-\\nform random walk. i.e. P(ei|ei−1, ri) = 1/|C(ei−1)|.\\nThen the rule probability P(e2|e1, h) can be computed di-\\nrectly from the KG.\\nTo learn the rule weights wr, we first observe that\\nPw(e2|e1, r) =\\nPw(r|e1, e2)\\nP\\ne∈E Pw(r|e1, e),\\nif we sample e1 and e2 independently and uniformly. Re-\\ncall Equation (3), we can instead model Pw(r|e1, e2) ∝\\n3In practice, we take T = 0.01.\\n3\\nUnderstanding the Reasoning Ability of Language Models From the Perspective of Reasoning Paths Aggregation\\nexp Sw(e2|e1, r). We can even further simplify it into a\\nbinary classification problem pi = Pw(1ri=r|ei\\n1, ei\\n2). Then\\nwe can use wr to parameterize a logistic regression model\\nwith a loss function:\\nLr(w) = −\\nX\\ni\\n[yi ln pi + (1 −yi) ln (1 −pi)] + λ|w|,\\nwhere pi =\\nexp Sw(ei\\n2|ei\\n1,r)\\n1+exp Sw(ei\\n2|ei\\n1,r), and the binary label yi =\\n1ri=r. λ|w| is a regularization term, and we can take any\\nappropriate norm on w.\\nAt training time, we sample positive triples with relation r\\nand negative triples with other relations from G as training\\ndata. We search over the graph to compute their probability\\nof being reached by each rule P(e2|e1, h) to compute pi.\\nFor computation efficiency, we only want to search for a\\nsubset of more possible logical reasoning rules Hr in the test\\nset for each relation r, and assign wr(h) = 0 for h /∈Hr.\\nNote that a rule can be infinitely long, so we set a maximum\\nrule length n ≤Nmax. To obtain Hr, we search over G, and\\nrecord all paths between any two entities that are connected\\nwith the relation r, and shorter than Nmax. We then collect\\nthe rules that have more than m valid paths.\\nA simplified version of Pw would be letting wr(h) = 1 for\\nall h and r. And we define this unweighted aggregation\\ndistribution to be Ps:\\nPs(e2|e1, r) =\\nexp(P\\nh∈Hr P(e2|e1, h)/T)\\nP\\ne∈E exp(P\\nh∈Hr P(e|e1, h)/T)\\n(4)\\n2.4. KL Divergence and Prediction Accuracy\\nTo better understand the similarity between LM and the\\nrandom walk aggregation algorithm as described in the pre-\\nvious section, we propose to compute and analyze the KL\\ndivergence between them: KL[Pw(e|e1, r), PLM(e|e1, r)],\\nwhere e is a random variable taking values in E. To better\\nunderstand the meaning of the computed KL divergence,\\nwe derive an upper bound of it by writing PLM(e2|e1, r) as\\nmarginalization over rules:\\nPLM(e2|e1, r) =\\nX\\nh∈H\\nP(e2|e1, h)PLM(h|e1, r)\\n(5)\\nSimilarly, we can write\\nPw(e2|e1, r) =\\nX\\nh∈H\\nP(e2|e1, h)Pw(h|e1, r)\\n(6)\\nThen by the Log sum inequality, we can see that the KL\\ndivergence of the rule importance is an upper bound of the\\ncomputed KL divergence 4:\\n4Proof available in Appendix.\\nProposition 2.1. If LM effectively learned the random walk\\ndata distribution through pre-training, we have\\nKL[Pw(e|e1, r), PLM(e|e1, r)] ≤KL[Pw(h|e1, r), PLM(h|e1, r)]\\nHere h is a random variable taking values in H. This means\\nthe KL divergence reflects how LM assigns probabilities\\nto possible logical rules based on the given prompt, which\\nimplies how the LM learns to do logical reasoning.\\nKL computation We compute the KL divergence between\\nthe weighted aggregation distribution Pw(e2|e1, r) as de-\\nfined in Equation (3) and the LM distribution PLM(e2|e1, r)\\nas defined in Equation (2), abbreviated as KL[Pw, PLM].\\nWe then compare it with the KL divergence between the\\nunweighted aggregation distribution Ps(e2|e1, r) as defined\\nin Equation (4) and the LM distribution, abbreviated as\\nKL[Ps, PLM]. To better understand the effect of random\\nwalk length, we consider maximum random walk path\\nlength ranging from 1 to 10 (i.e. 1 ≤Lmax ≤10 and\\n1 ≤Nmax ≤10), for computing both the aggregation\\ndistribution and the LM distribution. We then compute a\\npairwise KL between each of them and show the results as a\\nheatmap. To better anchor the computed KL divergence, we\\nalso compute the KL divergence KL[P ∗, PLM] between a\\nreference distribution P ∗and the LM distribution PLM, and\\nKL divergence KL[Pu, PLM] between the uniform distribu-\\ntion Pu and the LM distribution PLM. Here P ∗is uniform\\nover all correct answers, and Pu is uniform over all pos-\\nsible answers. The described KL divergences for Countries\\n(top) and UMLS (bottom) testing sets are shown in heatmaps\\nin Figure 2. More interpretations of these quantities can be\\nfound in the caption.\\nAccuracy We also compute the prediction accuracy using\\neach method and plot it w.r.t to path length (1 ≤Lmax ≤\\n10). Note that there could be more than one correct answer\\nfor a query (e1, r). We say the prediction is correct as\\nlong as it is one of the correct answers. The described\\ntesting accuracy for Countries (left) and UMLS (right) is\\nshown in Figure 3, where LM is arg max PLM, Weighted\\nis arg max Pw, and Unweighted is arg max Ps. In general,\\nLM predictor PLM performs on par/better than weighted\\naggregation Pw, and significantly better than the unweighted\\naggregation Ps. This shows that LM likely learns a better\\nlogical rule weighting scheme than Pw.\\n2.5. Results and Analysis\\nWe consider five KG datasets in total: Countries (Bouchard\\net al., 2015), UMLS (Kok & Domingos, 2007), Kinship\\n(Denham, 2020), NELL-995 (Xiong et al., 2017), and\\nFB15K-237 (Toutanova et al., 2015) 5. We take the smallest\\ntwo for KL divergence analysis for their lower time com-\\n5Dataset details can be found in Appendix.\\n4\\nUnderstanding the Reasoning Ability of Language Models From the Perspective of Reasoning Paths Aggregation\\nFigure 2. KL divergence between various reference distributions and LM distribution, with different maximum random walk lengths,\\naveraged over Countries (top) and UMLS (bottom) testing set, respectively. The rows correspond to the LM distribution PLM(e2|e1, r) with\\nmaximum pre-training random walk path lengths (Lmax) ranging from 1 to 10. From left to right, the columns correspond to the weighted\\naggregation distribution Pw(e2|e1, r) with maximum random walk path lengths (Nmax) from 1 to 10, the unweighted aggregation\\ndistribution Ps(e2|e1, r) with maximum random walk path lengths (Nmax) from 1 to 10, the reference distribution P ∗(e2|e1, r), and the\\nuniform distribution Pu(e2), respectively. A darker color represents a smaller KL value, meaning that the two distributions are closer.\\nIn general, KL[Pw, PLM] is always smaller than KL[Ps, PLM], which implies that LM is learning the difference in rule importance.\\nKL[P ∗, PLM] and KL[Pu, PLM] serve as anchor points to show the scale of KL values. KL[P ∗, PLM] is generally high because the\\nprobability mass concentrates on correct answers, thus it can be very different from the LM distribution. Thus KL[P ∗, PLM] shows how\\npeaky the LM distribution is, and KL[Pu, PLM] shows how flat the LM distribution is.\\nplexity. We show LM prediction accuracy for all datasets\\nwith different pre-training path lengths.\\nKL divergence with Countries In Figure 2 (top), we can\\nsee that when the maximum path length for computing the\\naggregated distribution (columns) is three, there is a sudden\\ndrop in KL[Pw, PLM]. This is because the ground truth path\\nlength to reach the correct answers in the testing set is three\\n(fixed when constructing the dataset). Both the weighted\\nand unweighted aggregation of random walk paths have\\nlow accuracy with path lengths less than three as shown\\nin Figure 3 (left). The behavior of the path aggregation\\nmethod is not well-defined at this stage and thus can result\\nin an abnormal KL trend. On the other hand, LM yields a\\nnon-trivial accuracy when trained with a path length smaller\\nthan three, which shows LM’s ability to generalize beyond\\nthe pre-training reasoning length. This echoes the findings\\nin Xiao & Liu (2023); Zhou et al. (2023), that Transformers\\ncan generalize to longer sequences than training sequences.\\nAs shown in Figure 2 (top left), the weighted aggregation\\nscheme Pw converges to a stable distribution, likely by\\nputting most weights on shorter rules when using long ran-\\ndom walk paths. The LM distribution PLM becomes closer\\nto Pw when the pre-training path length becomes longer.\\nOn the other hand, KL[Ps, PLM] stably increases when the\\npath length for Ps becomes larger. This echoes the accu-\\nracy trends as shown in Figure 3 (left). For the countries\\ndataset, since it only has two relations, longer random walk\\npaths introduce more noise than useful information. Thus\\nby increasing the path length the unweighted aggregation\\nscheme Ps becomes less and less effective. Both Pw and\\nPLM learn to assign a small weight to the long/noisy paths,\\nand thus do not experience an accuracy drop.\\nKL divergence with UMLS In Figure 2 (bottom), we can\\nsee that when the maximum path length for computing\\nthe aggregated distribution (columns) is larger than 3, the\\nweighted aggregation scheme Pw also converges to a stable\\n5\\nUnderstanding the Reasoning Ability of Language Models From the Perspective of Reasoning Paths Aggregation\\nFigure 3. Testing accuracy w.r.t. various maximum pre-training random walk lengths (1 ≤Lmax ≤10) on Countries (left) and UMLS\\n(right) datasets, respectively. For Countries, the LM (PLM) performance converges to the weighted aggregation (Pw) performance, while\\nfor UMLS, LM consistently outperforms both weighted (Pw) and unweighted (Ps) aggregation performance. This is likely because LM\\n(PLM) can learn a better logical rule weighting scheme than weighted aggregation (Pw) in more complex KGs.\\nFigure 4. Testing accuracy of LM trained on different random walk\\npath lengths. Each line corresponds to a different KG dataset and\\nthus is not directly comparable. We want to highlight the common\\ntrend here that each line peaks at some optimal path length.\\ndistribution. To investigate why path length 3 is unique, we\\nfind the average path length corresponding to the largest\\nnumber of valid paths for each relation in the testing set is\\n3.14. We find the average path length corresponding to the\\nlargest weight assigned by Pw when Nmax = 10 is 2.75.\\nThis confirms that path length three is likely a good rule\\nlength for many relations. However, from Figure 3 (right),\\nwe can see that both weighted (Pw) and unweighted (Ps)\\naggregation peaked at path length two instead of three. We\\nbelieve this is because when the rule length becomes larger\\n(i.e. larger than two), the validity of a rule would be more\\nhead entity (e1) dependent. Using only relation-dependent\\nweight wr(h) as in Pw is likely insufficient. This also ex-\\nplains why LM constantly outperforms both path aggrega-\\ntion methods: LM likely learns a rule importance function\\nthat depends both on the head entity and the relation.\\nDifferent from the Countries dataset, UMLS’ KL[Ps, PLM]\\ndoes not increase when the path length for Ps in-\\ncreases. Instead, KL[Ps, PLM] follows a similar trend as\\nKL[Pw, PLM], while in general KL[Pw, PLM] is smaller\\nthan KL[Ps, PLM].\\nSimilarly, in Figure 3 (right), the\\nweighted (Pw) and unweighted (Ps) aggregation has a\\nsimilar performance, while Pw is slightly better.\\nThis\\nshows that the logical rule weights learned by Pw are\\nsimilar between different rules, so it has similar effects\\n(KL and accuracy) as the unweighted version Ps. The\\nLM also has a flatter distribution, as we can see for\\nUMLS KL[P ∗, PLM] < KL[Pu, PLM] while for Coun-\\ntries KL[P ∗, PLM] > KL[Pu, PLM]. This is likely because\\nUMLS is more complex than Countries (49 v.s. 2 relations),\\nthus many longer paths and rules are similarly useful for\\nprediction, making the LM distribution flatter.\\nPrediction accuracy v.s. pre-training path length We\\nbriefly touched on how the pre-training random walk path\\nlength Lmax affects the LM distribution in the analysis\\nabove. In general, a longer path length improves the predic-\\ntion accuracy and decreases KL[Pw, PLM]. This shows that\\nLM can improve the logical rule weight assignment when\\ntrained with a longer path length. To further investigate\\nthis problem, we pre-train LM on longer random walk path\\nlengths with more KG datasets.\\nIn Figure 4, we show the LM prediction accuracy v.s. the\\nmaximum pre-training random path length of 1, 5, 7, 10, 15,\\nand 20, trained on five different KG datasets. In general,\\nthere is a large performance gain from a path length of 1\\nto 5. Note that when the path length is equal to one, we\\nrandomly sample individual triples from a KG. i.e. There\\nare no reasoning paths in the training data. So it is impor-\\ntant to have reasoning paths with a non-trivial length in the\\npre-training data, to enable the LM’s reasoning ability. By\\nextending the maximum length from 10 to 20, we can see\\nthat there is a slight drop in the Countries dataset. Similarly,\\nin most datasets, there is a small decrease after an optimal\\npath length. This is likely because a too-long random walk\\npath would contain more noise/unrelated triples for reason-\\ning. i.e. It is less likely to be useful for predicting the head\\nand tail entity relation in a path aggregation sense. On the\\nother hand, we can understand this from a localized data\\nstructure perspective (Prystawski et al., 2023): a sufficiently\\nlong random walk path makes any two entities similarly\\npossible to appear in the same path, thus hurting the local\\ndependency in the training data.\\n6\\nUnderstanding the Reasoning Ability of Language Models From the Perspective of Reasoning Paths Aggregation\\n3. Math Reasoning\\nAfter carefully analyzing the logical reasoning on KGs, we\\nwant to apply and verify the obtained insights on a more\\ninteresting and realistic case of reasoning: math reasoning\\nwith textual descriptions, which is usually called math word\\nproblems (MWPs). We continue training a pre-trained LM\\nwith random walk reasoning paths and show that these unla-\\nbeled paths consistently benefit math reasoning performance\\non three datasets. We also observe a similar optimal ran-\\ndom walk path length effect as in the logical reasoning case,\\nwhich is associated with the intrinsic reasoning length of\\ndifferent datasets. These results support our reasoning path\\naggregation hypothesis and imply principles for construct-\\ning/augmenting pre-training data.\\n3.1. Problem Setting\\nSuppose\\nwe\\nhave\\na\\nset\\nof\\ntraining\\ndata\\nD\\n=\\n{(xi, ri\\n1, ri\\n2, ..., ri\\nni, yi)}i, where xi is a question described\\nin the text that needs to be solved by math technique.\\nri\\n1, ri\\n2, ..., ri\\nni is a chain-of-thought (CoT) solution, where\\nri\\nj is one reasoning step. yi is the ground truth answer to the\\nquestion. Since MWP datasets are hard to collect and usu-\\nally small in size, a model is not likely to generalize to new\\nquestions by aggregating reasoning paths over this small\\nset of CoT reasoning paths. Fine-tuning on a pre-trained\\nLM can effectively mitigate this problem since the LM has\\nalready seen many other reasoning paths at the pre-training\\ntime, but more unlabeled reasoning paths specific to this\\ntask would likely improve the testing performance if the\\npath aggregation hypothesis still holds for this task.\\n3.2. Random Walk on Latent Reasoning Graph\\nWe assume that CoT paths ri\\n1, ri\\n2, ..., ri\\nni can be regarded\\nas random walk paths sampled from a reasoning graph G,\\nwhere the nodes are the reasoning states at each step ri\\nj.\\nThe reasoning state can be regarded as a belief that will be\\nupdated after each reasoning step. Denote the last hidden\\nstate pre-trained LM we are going to tune by fθ. To rep-\\nresent the reasoning state for each step ri\\nj, we propose to\\nuse fθ to cumulatively encode all the steps before ri\\nj, and\\nthen average over the sequence dimension, to obtain a fixed\\ndimensional vector si\\nj:\\nsi\\nj = avg fθ(xi, ri\\n1, ri\\n2, ..., ri\\nj)\\nAssuming similar si\\nj’s are sampled from the same node of\\nthe latent reasoning graph, we propose to cluster 6 similar\\nsi\\nj’s together to form a node. Suppose we have constructed a\\ngraph G from the CoT dataset D, with nodes A1, A2, ..., AK,\\nwhere K is predefined by the clustering algorithm. Each\\nCoT step would be classified into a node. i.e. ri\\nj ∈Am\\n6In practice we use K-meanings clustering.\\nAlgorithm 1 Random Walk on Latent Graph\\nInput: CoT dataset D, latent graph G, maximum path length\\nLmax.\\nRandomly initialize current node a = Ak. Initialize path p = []\\nrepeat\\nRandomly choose a CoT step ri\\nj ∈a.\\nUniformly sample m from [1, L].\\nAppend ri\\nj, ri\\nj+1, ..., ri\\nmin{j+m,ni} to path p.\\nSuppose ri\\nmin{j+m,ni} ∈Al. Set a = Al.\\nuntil len(p) ≥Lmax.\\nfor some m ∈[1, k]. Then we can perform random walks\\non the graph by using the original CoT as links between\\nthe nodes as shown in Algorithm 1. Then we record the\\nrandom walk paths produced by Algorithm 1 and do next-\\ntoken-prediction training on them for M steps. To make\\nsure the LM can produce a CoT solution and a final answer,\\nwe do another N −M step of supervised fine-tuning (SFT)\\non the original dataset D, for some N > M.\\n3.3. Experiments\\nDatasets. We conduct experiments on three math word\\nproblem (MWP) datasets: GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021),\\nAQUA (Ling et al., 2017), SVAMP (Patel et al., 2021). 7\\nTraining We do LoRA (Hu et al., 2021) parameter effi-\\ncient training in 8 bits with Llama 2 models (Touvron et al.,\\n2023b) because of computation limits. If not specified, we\\ndefault to using the 7B version.\\nResults. In Table 1, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our\\nproposed method against the supervised fine-tuning (SFT)\\nbaseline. We train both our method and SFT with N = 2500\\nsteps in total. The first M = 500 steps of our method are\\ncontinually pre-trained on random walk data, and then we\\ndo 2000 steps of SFT on the original dataset. Our method\\nis about 3% better in accuracy on average over three MWP\\ndatasets and two Llama 2 models.\\nThen we investigate the effect of random walk path length\\nLmax by plotting accuracy v.s. path lengths. In Figure 5, we\\nobserve that each dataset has a performance peak at a certain\\nrandom walk length. While both AQUA and GSM8K peak\\nat path length 10, the SVAMP dataset peaks at path length\\n5. This is likely related to the different intrinsic reasoning\\nlengths for different datasets. The average length of CoTs\\nin AQUA, GSM8, and SVAMP training sets are 4.79, 3.72,\\nand 1.36, respectively. The reasoning length required for\\nSVAMP is significantly shorter than the other two datasets,\\nthus explaining the earlier peaking. As we discussed in the\\nlogical reasoning case, a long random walk may introduce\\nmore noise than useful information. Note that even the\\nLM performance can drop after the optimal path length,\\n7Dataset details can be found in Appendix.\\n7\\nUnderstanding the Reasoning Ability of Language Models From the Perspective of Reasoning Paths Aggregation\\nModel\\nMethod\\nGSM8K\\nAQUA\\nSVAMP\\nAvg.\\n7B\\nSFT\\n26.8\\n30.0\\n53.3\\n36.7\\nOurs\\n28.5\\n34.6\\n55.8\\n39.6\\n13B\\nSFT\\n37.1\\n35.0\\n66.4\\n46.2\\nOurs\\n41.2\\n37.4\\n69.0\\n49.2\\nTable 1.

Testing accuracy of continue pre-training with our ran-\\ndom walk paths of different length Lmax. Each line corresponds\\nto a different MWP dataset and thus is not directly comparable. We\\nwant to highlight the common trend here that each line would peak\\nat some optimal path length range, which is similar to Figure 4.\\nit is always better than training with path length one. i.e.\\nmulti-step random walk always helps.\\nWe also do ablation studies on two critical hyperparameters\\nof our method: the number of steps training on random\\nwalk paths M and the number of clusters/nodes K. In\\nTable 2, we show that the optimal number of training steps\\nM is 500 for all three datasets. Since the generated random\\nwalk reasoning paths are not natural within small corpora,\\ne.g. the subject might be suddenly changed from one step\\nto another, training too many steps might make the LM\\noverfit the unwanted artifacts. In Table 3, we show that\\nthe optimal number of clusters is 100 for all three datasets.\\nHere 0 clusters mean the SFT baseline. Since the datasets\\nwe use are small in scale, clustering with a large number of\\nclusters may introduce more noise than useful matchings.\\nWe hypothesize that this may be solved by using a larger\\ndataset and more number of clusters/nodes K: in this case,\\nthe steps within each node will be more intrinsically similar.\\nThis also hints at the potential of our method in the actual\\npre-training stage: we can view each example in the pre-\\ntraining corpus as a reasoning path and apply our method.\\n#Steps\\nGSM8K\\nAQUA\\nSVAMP\\nAvg.\\n0\\n26.8\\n30.0\\n53.3\\n36.7\\n200\\n27.5\\n30.1\\n53.6\\n37.1\\n500\\n28.5\\n34.6\\n55.8\\n39.6\\n1000\\n24.9\\n32.3\\n51.6\\n36.3\\nTable 2.

Conclusion\\nIn conclusion, we aim to understand reasoning abilities in\\nlanguage models (LMs), from the perspective of aggregat-\\ning reasoning paths from pre-training data. The findings\\nshed light on the origins of LLMs’ remarkable reasoning\\ncapabilities, showcasing the importance of pre-training in\\nacquiring these skills. The construction of the pre-training\\nsequence, such as organizing it as ”chains” or random walks\\non the graph, was found to significantly impact the effec-\\ntiveness of reasoning. The study also revealed that LM be-\\n8More related work on logical reasoning and math reasoning\\ncan be found in the Appendix.\\n8\\nUnderstanding the Reasoning Ability of Language Models From the Perspective of Reasoning Paths Aggregation\\nhavior is similar to reason over known facts by aggregating\\nrelevant reasoning paths. These insights contribute to our\\nunderstanding of the underlying mechanisms behind LLMs’\\nreasoning abilities and lead to a potential pre-training data\\naugmentation technique to boost reasoning performance.\\nImpact Statement\\nUnderstanding the reasoning processes of large language\\nmodels (LLMs) through the lens of aggregating indirect\\nreasoning paths holds potential implications for identify-\\ning and mitigating potential biases within LLMs. By for-\\nmalizing reasoning as random walk paths on knowledge\\nand reasoning graphs, this approach not only elucidates the\\nmechanisms through which LLMs derive conclusions but\\nalso sheds light on data and reasoning paths that contribute\\nto their outputs. This insight is crucial for recognizing\\nbiases embedded in the training data or in the reasoning\\nprocess itself. Recognizing these biases is the first step to-\\nward developing more equitable and transparent models. By\\naugmenting models with unbiased, unlabeled random walk\\nreasoning paths, we can potentially reduce the influence\\nof biased reasoning patterns and improve the fairness and\\nreliability of LLMs in real-world applications. This research\\nadvances our understanding of LLM reasoning capabilities\\nand their implications for bias, paving the way for more\\nresponsible AI development and deployment.\\nReferences\\nAzerbayev, Z., Schoelkopf, H., Paster, K., Santos, M.

Proof\\nProposition A.1. If LM effectively learned the random walk\\ndata distribution through pre-training, we have\\nKL[Pw(e|e1, r), PLM(e|e1, r)] ≤KL[Pw(h|r), PLM(h|e1, r)]\\nProof. Recall that\\nPLM(e2|e1, r) =\\nX\\nh∈H\\nP(e2|e1, h)PLM(h|e1, r)\\nand\\nPw(e2|e1, r) =\\nX\\nh∈H\\nP(e2|e1, h)Pw(h|e1, r).\\nBy log sum inequality, we have:\\nKL[Pw(e|e1, r), PLM(e|e1, r)]\\n=\\nX\\ne2∈E\\nPw(e2|e1, r) log Pw(e2|e1, r)\\nPLM(e2|e1, r)\\n≤\\nX\\ne2∈E\\nX\\nh∈H\\nP(e2|e1, h)Pw(h|e1, r)P(e2|e1, h)PLM(h|e1, r)\\nP(e2|e1, h)Pw(h|e1, r)\\n=\\nX\\ne2∈E\\nX\\nh∈H\\nP(e2|e1, h)Pw(h|e1, r)PLM(h|e1, r)\\nPw(h|e1, r)\\n=\\nX\\nh∈H\\n(\\nX\\ne2∈E\\nP(e2|e1, h))Pw(h|e1, r)PLM(h|e1, r)\\nPw(h|e1, r)\\n=\\nX\\nh∈H\\nPw(h|e1, r)PLM(h|e1, r)\\nPw(h|e1, r)\\n=KL[Pw(h|r), PLM(h|e1, r)]\\nB. Detailed discussion of related work\\nTheory on LM reasoning Many recent works are investi-\\ngating LM’s reasoning ability. Geiger et al. (2021); Wu et al.\\n(2023) aims to find the causal abstraction of an LM. (Hanna\\net al., 2023) tries to find circuit for year-span-prediction.\\nLiu et al. (2023); Chi et al. (2023); Feng et al. (2023) show\\nthat CoTs enable fixed-size Transformers to perform certain\\ntypes of reasoning tasks. Li et al. (2023); Razeghi et al.\\n(2022); Wang et al. (2023) try to understand inference time\\nin-context CoT reasoning. Our study is more relevant to the\\nline of work analyzing the contribution of pre-training data\\nto LM reasoning. Bi et al. (2023) analyzes how code data\\naffect program-of-thoughts (Chen et al., 2023) reasoning\\nability. Xiao & Liu (2023); Zhou et al. (2023) study how\\nreasoning length generalizes from training data. Ramesh\\net al. (2023) studies LMs’ compositional generalization abil-\\nity. Our hypothesis also echos the conclusion of Malach\\n(2023) that reasoning paths in training data enable supervi-\\nsion on intermediate steps with next-token-prediction objec-\\ntive, and also increase the length complexity, thus reducing\\ntime/sample complexity at training time. Prystawski et al.\\n(2023) propose a different hypothesis that localized struc-\\nture on dependencies between variables in training data\\nis important for LM reasoning, especially CoT reasoning.\\nOur proposed hypothesis echoes theirs and can be shown\\neffective on more realistic data and tasks.\\nLogic/knowledge graph reasoning Existing methods can\\nbe divided into three categories: rule-based, GNN-based\\n(Gori et al., 2005), and LM-based. Markov Logic Network\\n(MLN) (Richardson & Domingos, 2006) and path ranking\\nalgorithm (PRA) (Lao et al., 2011) are two classical methods\\nthat assign weights to different logical rules. Neural Logic\\nProgramming (Yang et al., 2017) and RNN-logic (Qu et al.,\\n2020) are two neural methods that combine the explain-\\nability of learned logical rules and the high performance of\\nneural networks. R-GCN (Schlichtkrull et al., 2018) and\\nNBFNet (Zhu et al., 2021) are two GNN-based methods that\\ntrain a GNN on the KG and use the obtained triple embed-\\ndings. These two category methods either rely on random\\nwalks to find paths or use random walks to train GNNs. Re-\\ncently, LM-based methods are shown to be highly effective\\non not only KG reasoning (Misra et al., 2023), but more\\ngeneral logical reasoning problems with text descriptions\\n(Pan et al., 2023).\\nMath reasoning Recently, LM-based math reasoning mod-\\nels have shown to be highly effective (Azerbayev et al.,\\n2023; Yang et al., 2023). Many works have focused on\\ngenerating high-quality CoT training to improve LM’s math\\nreasoning performance (Wang et al., 2022; Nye et al., 2022;\\nYuan et al., 2023). However, they all rely on the annotated\\nQ-A pairs to generate corresponding paths with LM, which\\nlimits the size of augmented data and requires large LMs to\\ndo the CoT generation. Our proposed method does not need\\nsupervised seed data and thus can be extended to the vast\\namount of pre-training data. Our method is also lightweight,\\nwhich only requires a small/medium LM to produce the step\\nembeddings and then do clustering on them.\\nC. Experiment Details\\nC.1. Datasets\\nKnowledge graph datasets For KL analysis, we focus on\\ntwo KGs: Countries (Bouchard et al., 2015) and UMLS\\n(Kok & Domingos, 2007), as they have a reasonable time\\ncomplexity to compute the aggregated probabilities for long\\npaths. The Countries (Bouchard et al., 2015) contains two\\nrelations (locatedIn and neighborOf) and 227 enti-\\nties, including countries, regions, and subregions. We use\\nthe hardest version (S3) of the Countries. The Unified Med-\\n13\\nUnderstanding the Reasoning Ability of Language Models From the Perspective of Reasoning Paths Aggregation\\nical Language System (UMLS) (Kok & Domingos, 2007)\\nis a more complex KG built from biomedicine knowledge,\\ncontaining 49 relations and 135 entities. Example entities\\nare diseases and antibiotics, and example relations are treats\\nand diagnoses.\\nWe add three more datasets for computing the prediction\\naccuracy v.s. different random walk path lengths: Kin-\\nship (Denham, 2020), NELL-995 (Xiong et al., 2017), and\\nFB15K-237 (Toutanova et al., 2015). The Kinship dataset\\ncontains 104 entities and 26 kinship relationships among\\nmembers of the Alyawarra tribe from Central Australia.\\nThe NELL-995 dataset contains 75,492 entities and 200\\nrelations, which is built from the Web via an intelligent\\nagent called Never-Ending Language Learner. The FB15K-\\n237 dataset contains 14,505 entities and 237 relations de-\\nrived from Freebase. We adopt a processed version of these\\ndatasets from Das et al. (2017).\\nMath word problem datasets We conduct experiments on\\nthree math word problem (MWP) datasets: GSM8K (Cobbe\\net al., 2021), AQUA (Ling et al., 2017), SVAMP (Patel et al.,\\n2021). The Grade School Math dataset (GSM8K) contains\\n8.5K examples of linguistically diverse grade school math\\nworld problems. The AQUA-RAT dataset contains 100K\\nsamples of mathematical problems, along with sequences\\nof human-readable mathematical expressions in natural lan-\\nguage. The SVAMP dataset is a testing set consisting of\\nelementary-level MWPs. The training set is a combina-\\ntion of simpler MWPs: MAWPS (Koncel-Kedziorski et al.,\\n2016) and ASDiv-A (Miao et al., 2020) with 3.5k training\\nexamples in total.\\nC.2.
